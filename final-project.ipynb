The only really decent films since then have been Shang-Chi, NWH and Quantumania. Everything else has seemed subpar at best. But, GotG3 comes out tomorrow, we’ll see if it changes the game.\n",
      " @thesovietvorona1007  No. The quality is consistent. You got fooled by the structure of narrative. That chapter 1 isn't as exiting and cathartic as a final chapter doesn't make it not as good. Endgame isn't even in my top 5. No Way Home is much better than Endgame and almost as good as Winter Soldier. It's not like Incredible Hulk is any better than Love and Thunder. \n",

Shoot, I’d rather watch the 1970s Spider-Man ten times over than watch that. Love and Thunder although funny was not a movie I’d watch more than once, maybe twice in my entire life.

      "In the phase after the climax of the previous saga, the intensity needs to drop back down. Think about the phase 1 movies, none of them were a giant quest to save the universe from an invincible threat. Most were small, personal conflicts. Those types of conflicts make the most sense to me for origin stories. In most phase 4 movies, they're trying to be bigger and more intense than what was supposed to be the climax of the MCU.

That is extremely childish and honestly kind of pathetic. I'd also like to point out that you say that thor Love and Thunder was the worst performing movie in both phases 4 and 5, even though that's simply untrue. Antman 3 cost over 200 million to make with at least 100 million in marketing. It made 475 million. It needed to make at least 600 million to break even. You also say Shazam 2, making 100 million means it's a success, but you completely ignore the fact that it cost 125 million to make along with around 105 million in marketing. That movie failed. \n",

If you look up the MCU movies by box office phase one has all the lowest box office movies. The lowest one from phase 4 and 5 is Love and Thunder which made over 700 million.

I’d like to clarify that even 2 years later from the original comment, I still prefer Endgame over Infinity War.  However, this is purely subjective, as I understand the plotting in Endgame is quite terrible due to the mere existence of time travel.  The borderline assassination of Thanos and  Thor are also factors that have negatively affected my objective and subjective view of this movie.  I have also come to appreciate Infinity War a lot more, mainly due to the excellence of the character development in our heroes and the character building of Thanos.  Finally, I’d like to retract my claim of Endgame being the best marvel movie.  Even in the MCU, there are better written, actually sensical offerings to enjoy.  Have a good day.\n",

      "Game Bond Sorry, but the Dark Knight is still better. The story is better, the visuals are better, the music is better, the acting was better, the villains were better, etc. No comic book movie is better than the Dark Knight I’m sorry. Some are really close, but didn’t hit the nail.\n",
      " @reneepeck8094  if you get content better than its duration fullfilling everything in which people are invested with great development i dont even see whats so wrong... Just like tdk where batman's ark felt left out and so of others..\n",
      "Game Bond This is going to be one of my last comments since it’s clear that we will not be on equal agreement. When I say that TDk has great acting, that doesn’t mean that Marvel doesn’t have any great acting. Robert Downey Jr did a fantastic job as Iron Man, but his acting isn’t as good as some like Ekhart, Ledger, or Bale. I will be honest and say that the only great acting performances in Endgame was Robert, Jeremy Renner, and Tom Holland. All the other acting performances were just decent or fine. In what part of any of my comments did I ever become one sided or acting like a fanboy? You’re the one who called me delusional and retarded because I only said that TDK is the best comic book movie ever made. Just because I think the MCU is overrated doesn’t mean that it doesn’t have its merits. The action scenes are great, the cgi (sometimes) are incredible, the acting is usually good, etc. I just think that the Dark Knight hits the nails at those points better than any Marvel or DC movie that has come as of late.\n",
      "Game Bond I can be immersed in giant films like the MCU. I love the Lord of The Rings series because it’s an amazing epic, but since the MCU has made over 20 movies and only a few of them actually achieved the level of awesomeness as the Lord of The Rings.\n",

Even when TDKR got bad reviews, Nolan fans threatened the critics as well. ALL fanboys are bad, marvel AND DC, TDK trilogy fanboys are toxic. Not one or the other. Tdk was never perfect to me, I like it a lot, but never thought it was a masterpiece since the protagonist greatly lacked for me, and Rachel wasn’t that good of a character at all.\n",

Its not a masterpiece in every single way like people blindly praise imo\n",

      " @reneepeck8094  That's your opinion but mine is that its overrated as hell and heath ledger gets way too much credit only because he died. Imo Aaron Eckhart was better and batman begins was better. Logan,Infinity war, and the joker were better.\n",
      "Old Wolf's Legion I disagree whole heartedly although I can understand your perspective. I also agree it’s overrated, but I still think it’s a great movie even though it ain’t perfect (I would give it like a 4.5/5.). Even if Heath didn’t die, he still would’ve done an amazing job and still is one of the best acting performances in the comic book genre regardless of his death. I mean he’s still better than almost everyone in the comic book genre when it comes to acting. Aaron Eckhart did get overshadowed unfortunately, but still a great actor as well. I wouldn’t consider Batman Begins better tbh because the Dark Knight improves on everything that Batman Begins did like acting, music, story, writing, villain, characters, etc. I can’t even think of one thing that Batman Begins did better. I dare say that The Dark Knight is the second greatest sequel of all time (First being Blade Runner 2049 imo). I can see how you think Joker and Logan is better, but Infinity War? Infinity War might be good, but it ain’t on Logan’s level.\n",

      "Multiversus saga will probably be very good, with Kang Dynasty and Secret Wars, but...I don't think will have the impact that Infinity War ( and Endgame ) had. Sure, will be many heroes brought together ( again ), some of them may be from old movies, but many of them are kinda new. She hulk, kamala khan, moon knight, eternals, so on. In the past, we had many movies with our loved characters and actors, so we tied a bond with them. Now, many of them ( avengers ) won't return and they need to fill the space with some new guys. No offence for the ones I mentioned like She hulk, kamala khan, moon knight, etc and also no offence for all the fans that love these characters. But...we only had one movie with them, or some short episodes show, and we didn't tied a bond with them and also, let's be real, they ( at least these ones ) aren't as notorious like old avengers. I would also say many of them not as powerful as old avengers, but, don't want to start a polemic. So, that's my point of view. Kang Dynasty and Secret Wars will be great ( needs to be ) but, I don't think will be epic like Infinity saga.\n",

I mean, nobody's near Marvel. There is nothing that comes close to it as franchise and movie universe. Lord of rings, they are good, but they are not as popular, Harry Potter is great, but it didn't conquered whole world in level of MCU. Fast and Furious is good too cuz it made many movies and is commercial success, but it didn't get too popular in level of Marvel. Transformers are a lot of commercial success but didn't conquered fans and become popular in level of fans. DC movies getting better but not close to Marvel and certainly don't influence culture much. Star Wars in last times became more of, niche or a bit smaller, I mean in terms of its influence and power on culture. You get the point. They are good, but they aren't close to MCU. MCU managed to conquer lots of people and most human population, and became a cultural phenomenon\n",

      "i didn’t say it would be the same experience but i meant that i can still enjoy it.  Besides, if i watched it when it came out i would’ve been really confused because i hadn’t seen much of the other movies. watching it on disney i was able to watch the others and then enjoy endgame\n",

      " @onderokay3805  Yeah, it would!  Who knows when they'll decide to make that movie though. They would have to set the storyline up so that both universes mixing together makes sense, and knowing Marvel that would be over a couple movies.\n",

      "Man... The whole world was hyped for infinity war and endgame😃😃😃\n",
      " @mishukhroy6013  Yes, they were. Even me. But when I saw it, that was the turning point. They were a good film for action but that's as far as I can say about it. It's like watching the original Lion King and then watch the new live action one. Once you know something, it feels different when you see something else.\n",
      " @jpotent1019  yeah... Exactly...but anyways... I still remember those hyped feelings of mine... Most of the time I was thinking about what's gonna happen... Those days were good😁🤘\n",

      " @threetreasures7698  lol ye have little\n",
      "Faith. If it’s one thing is humans do, we find a way to make great things happen. Think about how hype Star Wars was because it was the first of the fantasy/action big cinema kind. You don’t think in 60 years someone could out do avengers like avengers out did the movies before. It’s not like this is with superstardom of music artists like MJ, Queen, etc. where people just aren’t being superstars like that anymore. Cinema is still growing. Have faith my friend. Don’t be so drastic lol\n",

      "\n",

      "This never fails me to drop me into nostalgia when mcu was at peak\n",
      "Tears to my eyes. The MCU at the peak of its powers was something to behold. I miss these days. It’s unfortunate and rather strange how quickly they lost the magic after the infinity saga. I remember after endgame saying “I know there’s so many more stories to tell, but I would not be mad if they ended the MCU right here.” How little did I know at the time that I wish that’s what WOULD have happened. I’m writing this fresh off the conclusion of secret invasion and man it’s sad to see what the MCU has become. Still amazing to reminisce.\n",
      "Finally seeing thanos go completely unhinged against everyone in this was totally epic. After years and years of teasing him, the avengers finally met their match. Seeing this movie in the theater the first time was such a surreal experience with everyone else in there. If you didnt, you definitely missed out.\n",
      "Is anyone else so grateful this and Endgame came out before Covid could stop us seeing it in Cinemas? It would've been absolute agony if these movies were delayed\n",
      "I wish we get another Marvel movie like this one. Infinity War is awesome. It’s a shame that the MCU is dead and we are getting terrible movies now. I will never forgive Disney for what they did to Marvel and the MCU.\n",

      "I am still watching this, and getting the same goosebumps 🔥🔥🔥\n",
      "I’ve been rewatching all of the MCU recently, and I have yet to revisit Infinity War by the time of me writing this. Seeing this trailer again is truly a special moment, this is telling you that everything these heroes have been throughout an entire decade is nothing compared to the true final boss of this entire saga. The stakes are even higher than they have ever been, everybody is going to play their part in this massive event, the action is going to go all out even harder than it ever had, and the villain will be NOTHING like anyone else before him. This was THE movie that all of its predecessors have been building up to all these years. Truly one of the most epic moments in all of cinema, preserved in this time capsule of a trailer.\n",
      "\n",

      "Dr Strange’s time loop only stopped Dormammu because it got annoyed and left. It would be weird and out-of-character in my opinion if Thanos just got bored and stopped his plan because of the time loop, as Thanos was established up to that point in the movie as someone extremely devoted to his plans. And since Thanos wouldn’t stop, Strange could have just continued it forever, but that isn’t really saving half the universe as much as it is imprisoning the WHOLE universe in an inescapable repeating loop (I would have tried to use more words than loop but I can’t really think of any synonyms for it off the top of my head lol).\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the time stone, could you provide a more specific moment you think it should’ve been used? I feel like it wouldn’t have really helped during the Ebony Maw fight, he couldn’t use it on the ship as if he tried doing the motions with his hands Maw’s spikes would’ve impaled him, he does use it to determine the different futures leading up tot the confrontation with Thanos, and then when Thanos does arrive Strange doesn’t even have the stone because he’s hiding it in place of a fake. I might be forgetting something but I can’t remember a moment in the movie where he doesn’t already use the time stone that it would have changed anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the sling rings, Thanos has the space stone and can teleport anywhere, coupled with his extremely durable skin.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do agree with your final question about them not just stabbing Thanos while in his trance or something like that, however just like the points before this I feel the movie is  not really made any worse by having a few plotholes in it, because none of these things really create big unexplained flaws in the movie or affect the viewing experience, and I don’t think they’re really worth bringing up as they aren’t even really something you would think of unless you actively tried to poke holes in the movie’s logic. \n",
      "\n",
      "As for Thanos having a bunch of different ways to solve his plan, I agree that his plan is dumb. But I don’t think that’s a problem with the movie, because he is the villain and you’re supposed to disagree with him. Thanos is shown in Infinity War and Endgame to be a character who, as wise as he thinks he is, is still at his core an egotistical sociopath, and as a result it makes sense that his plan, which on surface level seems noble, is really insane under the lens of a normal person not warped by Thanos’ twisted ideas.\n",

      "I wish I could time travel back to the year between Infinity War and Endgame when EVERYONE was talking about it. That was the year of memes. The hype for Endgame was amazing. Except for when it first came out and these kids at my school were spoiling everything. I feel really bad for future kids who will never get the experience of the MCU. And I get you can watch the movies, and it's still amazing and a big deal, but nothing can top the excitement of seeing Endgame and Infinity War and cheering in the theaters and crying in the theaters and walking out of the theaters having an existential crisis. Nothing can beat counting down the exact days and hours until Endgame came out. Nothing can beat being able to randomly bring up anything from the movie and everyone knowing what you were talking about because they all watched it too. And I also feel bad about other movies, too. I feel like the biggest movies ever have already come out. ex. Star Wars, How To Train Your Dragon, MCU, Wonder Woman, Pirates of the Caribbean. Infinity War and Endgame weren't just movies. They were events.  That's why the MCU is probably the greatest form of art ever made. The characters are all so developed, complicated, and make mistakes like real people. They deal with real issues in the movies, too, like Tony reacting to learning that Bucky killed his parents, and how a whole motivation for the Vulture was losing his job because of the messes being cleaned up. They never talk about how the superheroes have made messes while saving the world in other movies. Even though the MCU isn't exactly realistic, it still kind of is. Some people might say that it's not realistic because they crack jokes all the time and if it were real they'd be so scared, but I would argue that's realistic because people often joke. After all, it's easier than showing you're scared. It's a great way to cope. Anyway, I don't know where this is going. I guess I was trying to say that the characters feel like real people and they really make you care about them. It also helps that every actor in the MCU is perfect for the role and they could never ever be replaced. (I mean, RDJ is basically just playing himself.)\n",

      " @Stxmm  I feel you. On hindsight, I don't remember much about the movie, but I have to say that it's my best ever theatre experience, even better than Infinity War and Endgame. The last Marvel movie I watched in theatres before No Way Home was Endgame, so it was like nearly a 3 years gap. I was late to the theatre and by the time I got into my seat, Murdock caught the brick. The audience already started screaming, and did so every 5 minutes. Every Marvel movie has this different style, and carries the weight of all it's preceding movies. I had forgotten that feeling but I got it all back during that movie. I can't explain it but it really felt so good, as if you're meeting an old friend after a long time. The experience was my best because I watched it with my friends and turned the theatre into a stadium. I had watched IW and Endgame with my family, so I didn't scream that much.\n",

Perhaps in Kang Dynasty or Secret Wars. Perhaps Spider-Man can hear it. Or all the younger heroes training to be the Young Avengers. But overall, I think it should be used in the actual final MCU/Avengers film. I know we don't know when that could possibly ever happen. But I feel like it would be a nice way to bring things full circle. Picture it. The movie starts and the screen is just pitch black. Then we hear Nick Fury giving the whole speech and then is when the Marvel Studios logo happens. Or the speech can happen over the logo. Another way it can happen is that we see Nick Fury all alone and getting ready for the biggest battle they are ever going to face and while that happens, we hear the narration.\n",

      " @username.exenotfound2943  Exactly my thought too first half of endgame was necessary but dull and like i said it needed to happen to redeem the heroes who siezed to exist in infinity war, for me the ending in tony stark's funeral blessing and heartwarming to see everyone there together and final battle was amazing too\n",
      "endgame and infinity war are one movie and you guys are still comparing it they had to split both so you know give people hype and box office moneh\n",
      "To be honest, personally it was more shocking than endgame.\n",
      "For all of y’all saying how IW is better than Endgame cuz of the action, we know 😐. U can’t have a villain decimate half the universe with the heroes remaining that couldn’t do anything to stop it. They put character development into heroes so your not gonna get a whole bunch of action ALL the time, sorry. They’re both basically one movie anyway so there’s no need to compare. They are EQUAL😁. Endgame may not have had as much action but it was enough to finish the Infinity War story.\n",
      "Yes\n",
      " @mazikeensmith9135  I don't think they are a single movie. There are many differences between one part and another.\n",
      " @amercarroll1743  No, both films have too many differences to consider them a single movie. Also, I don't think that's the reason why many prefer Infinity War. \n",
      "For me IW is better because it is more intense. There were many moments when I thought the characters would die (and it turned out that I was correct). I felt that Thanos was an enemy that they could not defeat (this also turned out to be correct). Endgame, except for the beginning and the climax, is a walk in the park. The protagonists are supposed to feel devastated by what happened but they don't stop making jokes and having fun while doing the most important mission of their lives.\n",
      "Ratchet Achenbach but I do see your point.\n",
      " @amercarroll1743  But Endgame's jokes completely break the supposedly depressing atmosphere. The ones from Infinity War work a lot better even though it's a much darker movie than the sequel.\n",
      "Ratchet Achenbach no they don’t. They lighten the mood in SOME parts of the movie. For the most part the beginning is a pretty grim tone.\n",

That's why there are not a lot of action in the movie but it's still a lot better than infinity war. It also gives us a glimpse of the back to back archival footage of the past mcu film that we didn't get to see in the past. Remember NO STAIRS. And also Tony gets to have a chance to have a heartwarming father-son moment with 1970s Howard bc Howard died in civil war after his argument with 17 year old Tony.

It's no Infinity war i'm not arguing that i think Infinity war is better. However I think the first half of endgame has some great moments,  that really help make that movie. Cap in the elevator, Thor proving he's still worthy is really great because of how they sell his trauma, so when he gets Moljnir back its a great moment. Plus we get to see characters like Tony and Nebula in intimate scenes together which is unique to endgame.

      "Endgame had to be done the way it was: Seriously, how could they have placed more fighting/action/excitement in Endgame? They just lost half of their life force, so obviously that would cause a lot of \"downtime\" in the film. But necessary to develop the plot and bring everyone together for the fight in the end. It's also the last film in phase 3 and I think they did a great job in re-visiting big moments from the past films. And of course \"Avengers assemble\" which we were all waiting for,  and \"I am Iron Man\" had to have been saved for the the last and best moment(s). Endgame is a banger!\n",
      " @StretchDub  Let me start by saying this: The movie is ok. It's a good time passer. I'd watch it if there was nothing else on. But what I'm telling you is, that this movie is not accurate at all. If I didn't know anything about the comics, cartoons, anime, video games or whatever, I'd say what everybody else is saying...that this is a PERFECT movie. But I do know my history and this movie is completely inaccurate.\n",
      " @jpotent1019  Well ya hasn't all the films prior to this one been pretty much inaccurate? That's y the comics r the comics and the mcu is the mcu. They're done differently type a thing.... The mcu is comic inspired thats all. Even in WandaVision and FalconxWinter..... They're based on certain comics but they've put their own spin on it. Even in Endgame when Hulk was holding up the headquarter building as it was collapsing... I know that was a comic ref.... So they still honor Stan Lee's legacy n stuff u kno.... And Im sure Stan Lee was proud for what the mcu has done\n",
      "\n",
      "I\n",
      " @StretchDub  Man, HELL NO! How in the world are they honoring SL by putting their own spin on it?? That crap wasn't approved and they know it. In case you don't know, SL didn't even like Tom Holland as Spiderman! Want to know why? Because they made him soft as hell! It's cool to make their own storyline, that's ok. But weakening certain heroes is out the question.\n",
      " @jpotent1019  Okay maybe im wrong about them honoring SL them. But\n",
      "Tom Holland is soft? Is it cuz \"his\" spiderman is goofy, and immature? Cuz thats what im likely to expect from a teen. And didn't he take on Vulture head on? And the way he lifted the rubble that he was buried under. And he stopped Winter soldier's punch with one arm(im not sure how strong W.S. is) but still....\n",
      "One thing i was surprised on was how bad Hulk got beat by Thanos.... And then he was afraid to come out later in the film..... Im not sure if that happened in the comics but that imo is turning Hulk soft as hell lol!\n",
      " @jpotent1019  Yeah the mcu made a lot of characters goofy/added humor to them. Thor is another one. But wait.... How is this Peter not a genius? Didn't he impress Tony Stark with his self designed web shooters once Tony saw it for the first time? And in Far From Home, didn't we see him orchestrating that same level tech that Tony was using?\n",
      " @StretchDub  You're kidding right? I can't believe you don't know this or even saying this. That's something they made up. But here's the thing, to be honest, Tony Stark in reality has nothing to do with Peter Parker. Especially making his suit and then taking it away and giving it back. Etc etc. Peter Parker ALWAYS made his own suits! He never needed Tony Stark. Spiderman is really Spiderboy. This new kid is sorry. Not how Peter Parker is supposed to be. They should've gotten someone a little older.\n",
      " @jpotent1019  Well i guess its another one if those things that marvel chose to change up.... We had Toby Maguire, and Andrew Garfield that we portrayed spiderman differently.... And now Tom who is also different. I don't see whats wrong with the change. I'm aware that their movies aren't part of the phases in marvel, but we still got to see Spider-Man in various manners. Why they chose someone so young is beyond me, but at least we'll be able to see him grow and be on that character development journey with him\n",
      "KARTIK SINGH Yeah i guess u can say that\n",
      " @StretchDub  You say what's wrong with change? Tell me, what's wrong with consistency? Why do you think people are always saying how the old is always better than the new? I'm sure you even said that before. I don't need to see all sides of Spiderman. Just show me one side. Now Toby, so far, is the best Spiderman ever! They stuck to the script with him.\n",

      " @amercarroll1743  I don't even know if it's 'just' the action. I think in IW it was also just super super hype to see all these MCU franchises come together and see characters meet each other and interact. In Endgame it was more of the standard Avengers group, who've alreayd had a bunch of interactions before.\n",
      "The team-ups in IW feel like very well thought out with who bounces well off each other. In Endgame it's still well thought out, but who's alive feels more like what's best for the story and some character development (like Peter is dead to give a more emotional view on Tony). And generally speaking a lot of ppl also find Thanos less good, which is prob what they wanted to go for, but it might influence how good you find the movie. \n",
      "But yeah the interactions in IW really feel like a one time opportunity and moments that you have to cherish because some team-ups might not happen anymore because of Tony, Steve & Natascha being gone f.e. And some we'll just not see in some while (like GotG and Thor).\n",

Thanos was executed so well, a villain that no matter how much you disagreed with him, some part of you still understood his perspective. Everyone giving everything they can to defeat him, all end with failure. The entire movie is a roller coaster,  up, down and all around. At the end of it? So many people left feeling utterly shocked, and to some, completely defeated.\n",

      " @aldyrasyid  no I don't mean the movie I'm talking about the trailers\n",
      " @thecalamity278  yeah, the Joker trailers are much better then these visually. When you remember the context and the day the trailer dropped, this one beats the rest. Hard to accept that if you already feel some type of way about the movies tho. Marvel's not everyone's cup of tea 😂\n",
      " @aldyrasyid  I don't mind marvel movies but visuals aside, the Joker trailer is much better\n",

      " @thegoliath9310  still not touching this trailer tho. This trailer is top 3\n",
      " @kwesietsibah2917  definitely. But ZSJL is easy top 10. I mean... Considering what happened a few years ago, the amount of hype it's getting is spectacular. It could very well mean the beginning of a good DCEU. You must realize that, with DC's resources and iconic characters, all it needs is momentum and it really won't take long to compete with and beat Marvel. Marvel only started getting more popular around 2008, with Iron Man. And it took them till, like mid Phase 2 to start beating DC. With DC's iconic characters and simple nostalgia, DC can very easily beat Marvel. They just needs some better writers.\n",
      " @thegoliath9310  also we are talking about trailers. This isn't starting nothing. Because the dceu is done. They already making a trilogy with another batman. They've already made a different joker film to the Jared Leto.  And wonder woman 1984 wasnt very good . So it's not starting anything anytime soon.\n",
      " @thegoliath9310  the hype is basically comparable to loki and that's a tv series 😂\n",
      " @kwesietsibah2917  DC beat Marvel for decades. They can do it again. I am not saying they will, or that it will be soon. I am not saying Avengers is at all bad. (It pretty much is cgi and jokes at this point but I digress.) I am saying that DC is not as down as you think.\n",
      " @thegoliath9310  also marvel was basically beating dc at the end of phase one. Avengers grossed more than all the dark knight films. So realistically they already ahead. They have been basically been ahead for about 9 years .\n",
      " @kwesietsibah2917  several decades > 9 years.\n",
      " @thegoliath9310  cgi and jokes? I dont know if u have been keeping up 😂. Coz wandavision is very serious.  Isnt that what dc is as well. I mean the whole batman vs superman film was a joke in itself.  They are basically down as I think. Iconic characters dont save u from years of mistakes.  A good structure does. And kevin feige has the best structure.  A structure that dc tried to copy and embarrassed themselves in the process\n",

There was nothing like it before and I doubt there will be again.  You are right in 20 years, when the super hero movies are long dead, a re-release would be huge.

He didn't even last a minute against Thanos and just seemed like a brute in fighting despite his two years of training in Sakaar shown through his fight with Thor in Ragnarok, and in Endgame, even though his arc makes sense (people are scared of the Hulk, as well as Banner, who can't control it, but now he can, and everyone loves him), I wish he did more in the final battle, like maybe he would be the one to destroy the ship instead of Captain Marvel. Both films didn't utilize him the right way, and I'm not saying these films are flawless (imo they're 8/10 in terms of quality), but they're near-equal, as I'm tired of audiences saying IW >>> EG and critics saying EG >>> IW.\n",
