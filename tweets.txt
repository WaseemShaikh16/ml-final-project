Infinity War was MCU peak. 5 years and still have chills everytime I watch this trailer. Sad to see what the MCU once was and what it is right now.
I’m back here after 5 years…. 5 years and this trailer still gives me chills
I can’t believe it’s already been 5 years (literally half a decade) since this came out. Still one of the best things Marvel has ever released
No movie trailer will ever live up to the hype that this one did
It's been 5 years since this masterpiece came out. It makes me sad knowing that this was the beginning of the end of something truly beautiful.
Came back after 5 years just to feel the hype like the 1st time, who knows if we'll ever get this level of excitement again in the mcu
This Trailer will always have a special place in my heart ❤
Can't believe it has been 5 years..
Still watching the trailer gives me Goosebumps 😊
5 years later and i still get chills
The fact marvel fans still come back to watch this is HISTORIC
me
Who isn't?
I just hope MCU will bring us more masterpiece sagas like the Infinity one
It’ll never reach these heights again. No matter what. I’m glad it had a great run and finally ended on good note with an epic finale.
 @noahclark7603  Me too, so grateful to witness MCU era.
Me.
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 life’s just not the same anymore
hopefully Galactus will be the next big villain
THANOS NEEDS TO COME BACK WE NEED ANOTHER MOVIE!!!
Me
I keep telling people to move on
Some do 
But not us
So yh I am
I havent even wathed it yet lol
No i'm not depressed unlike you i got a life to keep going on but i'm disappointed of Endgame.
Somebody didn’t get their sleep
 @noahclark7603  Secret Wars: Hold my Multiverse
Yes
Well the infinity saga is over but there is still galactus and other villians to make movies about
I want this era once again but I doubt it. Probably there wouldn't be anything like this again for at least 10-20 years
Just you wait... Galactus is near.
Juan Villarreal no they won't
Me
End Game sucked
It would Take 20 Years For This Hype to Come Back
as There Might Be New Movies With New VFX or Maybe Threaters
But Still Wont Forget This
Yeah no hype will never be the same like it was for Infinity War and Endgame
Yeah me
Mee!!!
Nope bro, endgame is just an opening of another era for avenger. We'll gonna wait for galactus, the living tribunal and  the beyonder.
Me 🤧
Me kinda, but I'm excited for the future, there will be more hype build up like this..
Galactus and Doctor Doom will be brought to the MCU so get ready for Phase 4 and 5
IW and EG are only a fraction of what Marvel Studios can give us
Don't be sad because it's over be happy that it happened
Yes. But a thing isn't beautiful because it lasts.
Maybe we lost the best ones but at least we should be grateful we're going to see the rest of them, phase four is coming and I'm excited about it
 @trxndesign3331  oh my god me too i began the MCU when i was 4 (Iron Man 1's Release) i remember begging my parents to take me 😢 better times
Me😭😭
Yeah

But let's be thankful we could witness it at all :)
Nathan Leung it’s not over their making a new saga this was the infinity saga since the first iron man to end game but know..... know we must fight a new battle ...... now .... it’s Galactus.........
ME
No
nope
Nathan Leung Meee!
Me
It's me😢
I am so depressed
No
Yes
Me
Nathan Leung yeah
Meeeee😰😰😰😰😰😰😭😭😭😭😭😭
yeap...
Me
yep I having a moment rn lol..
Even though there are more MCU movies to come. Ain’t no crossover is going to be as epic as this one. You can experience this level of hype only once in your life, because once the second big crossover happens, you already know what to expect.
TheRudyextreme while yes you are completely right about that, I think Galactus is coming into the MCU, and I think he’s gonna be the next big villain that’s teased until they all come together again, just a thought tho
r_h_888 But still, it won’t feel the same.
I know right?
me
TheRudyextreme yeah ur right
Me
Who isn't?
Thor Pegasus If they lose Spiderman, no, they won't.
Nathan Leung just wait for 10 more years
Same😭🥺😍
69 comments, perfectly balanced as all things should be

I remember watching cap catch proxima midnight’s staff. That entrance will forever be one of the greatest moments of all time. It was bone chilling to see cap return with the avengers theme. It carried so much weight and emotion because of what happened during civil war. I wish i could re-live it :(
yep brother
You got 3000 likes
You think this is over? Haha
Me
 @noahclark7603  u sure about that ?
me :c
Iam mate. Its sad to know we are getting no more avengers movies with thor, ironmna etc. We are having a new avengers movie tho called THE NEW AVENGERS.
I am happy it's over. I hated that these films all propped up Iron Man at the expense of many other characters, and then they killed Black Widow and Gamora? WTF. Looking forward to when they eventually reboot the universe.
 @Microtjuh  ikr two movies is just not enough for such a big villain
It’s not over yet...
Galactus will come they said...
Man I think everyone is. And after hearing that mcu will not have such big events moving forward is even more depressing. The build and the hype was one of the best part about these movies. And sometimes I really wish I can go back to live that hype again.
It's not over. The MCU will continue starting next year
There's more to come bois
Nathan Leung it’s not over, it’s just the start
✋
Nathan Leung this GAVE ME depression
Need someone to gather the stones again ans snap thanos back
:'(
Ended on a good note but this will always give me chills!
I was but i grow
Older
Phase 3 is over but phase 4 just started.
Same
Me.
Nathan Leung me
More await their arrival. Don’t worry.
Nathan Leung not over
me
I can relate
I am bevause this and Harry Potter ended
Part of the journey is the end my friend. There’s obviously going to be more movies after endgame but for me, endgame was a perfect ending for the MCU.
LOVING SOUL -No they won't. If everything I read about, then they'll have the X-Men vs Avengers movie, like in the graphic novels.
Hello there
Don't be sad cause it's over, smile because it happened :)
Yes!
Im going to miss this hype 😢😭😭😭
Yes...
it's not ...... tust me
Nathan Leung Yeah. No matter what Marvel does in Future Avengers movies, nothing will be as big as IW/EG
No
Meeeee
If it was possible
I would have made my mind erased to watch it all over again
TRXN Design oh yes . Next the avengers , fantastic four, x men and guardians of the galaxy will face galactus and doctor doom . Just think of how many new heroes we will have by then
ME!!
 @hamidarash5310  no. Because I can still go back and rewatch every minute of it. Once I buy all 4 phases of the mcu (phase one, two, three, and phase three part 2) I can relive the greatest film franchise ever created.
 @ImTyde  But you wont have the hype, excitement, joy and other feelings which is what makes this all great
 @Microtjuh  - They can always bring him back from another timeline. 

After all, he is...inevitable.
Me man
Phase 4
Nathan Leung meee!!! I never be this hype about a movie ever again
"Part of the journey is the end"
Nathan Leung me
I'm depressed and never watched any of them, does that count?
Hell yeah
Yep
Yes
Galactus will be next
Yes
Nathan Leung Meh, they made Captain America, Thor, and even Iron Man (somehow him especially) popular. 

Now they have most of Marvel's A-listers, Spider-Man, the X-Men, the Fantastic Four. Each of them alone could singlehandedly fill an entire saga, so having all of them plus most of the OGs at the same time? Unless Disney or Sony executives start getting hands on and ruin the MCU, I expect nothing but improvements. 

If the MCU could thrive with nothing but B-listers and worse for half a decade, I highly doubt that it's going to come crashing down now that their all-stars are in.
Without the ogs the mcu is nothing! They were the ones that started everything and came into our hearts making us want more and more! They are irreplaceable and lets not stop hoping that we can get more of the ones that were there from the start❤️
I just want to erase my memory of MCU movies and re-experience the greatest era of all time. Want to feel those first time goosebumps and thrilling fear for my favorite characters. Want to feel the suspense and reveal with the audience once again in theatres. MCU was an experience of a lifetime. It will remain close to my heart no matter if people call it kids movie or whatever.
Im more depressed that endgame is now real.
Meeeee! Fck! I wanted more of this😢😢
Nathan Leung I am
Trust me the real war ain't start yet
CIA We want Deadpool and F4
Corona virus:"Oh it's not over yet. In fact this is just the beginning."
it only beginning!
im just glad i lived to see it all unfold
Now we have to wait 3-4 years for the next avengers movie
Its ok mate because part of the journey is "the end"
 @noahclark7603  It depends


Mutants, Dr. Doom, Apocalypse, Galactus, and even stories like Secret Wars, plus even a possible Venom Verse-MCU crossover could be great, especially the last one because we'd have darker Sony movies alongside the lighter MCU ones shared inside the same universe.
Yes
Nathan Leung not anymore ayeeee
Oh but we have Captain Marvel to look forward to!


pls kill me
FreshAsFabreze please don’t let Galactus be another space fart like in FF2
Its not all ove rthere is still Eternals, Shang Chi, Falcon Cap and most importantly, Captain Marvel and so much more! No reason to be depress! Plenty more MCU goodness!
Don't be sad  that its over Be happy because it happened...
🙋😭
Avengers still lives this phase is complete avengers 5 is coming
 @noahclark7603  you never know that future is unpredictable
Me 😔
We
Mee
Depressed would be a huge overstatement
Me

Nasri Rosman yeah. I wish the black widow movie would just come out on Disney plus
Oh man..I cant believe that it's over...
Master Of Wind actually they’re releasing new movies
Yeah
My people skills are rusty my people skills are nonexistent
100% me
Rest easy kobe
It's no over, man
Don’t abuse the term depression like that. You have no idea what depression is.
Yeah 🥺
Me
Not us...I wanted this 10 years of bullshit which was happening again and again to end. Marvel,  come up with some new kind of stories. Fed up with the same an army of heroes going up against a supervillain.
Me. But thats why I feel it should stop. Leave on a high note. 
Endgame- OK well as high note as possible.
There will be new MCU/Avengers Movies
me 🥺
me
nah i am happy. it was a beautiful run and for the entire duration it didnt derailed from its path. and it ended up satisfactory.  As a fan who started it from 0 to end game it was good and i am happy with what it was.

Now tbh  i lost all interest in MCU maybe i will turn in for thor but tbh with what they said about it. i doubt. they will do him down and dirty with "female thor" and it doesnt sounds good.
 @noahclark7603  their will be something like this again in the mcu
But the only way for it to reach those heights is for it to be the end end of the mcu
We have to have an avengers were everybody out of other universes come into play and battle the person trying end time
 @trxndesign3331  it isn’t a masterpiece
 @NoThankYouToo  oh shut up. You don't know it either. It's much much darker
Yep
It is 😭
Yea
Nope
It was one hell of an era
Marvel will be forgotten
Next is going to be The devour of worlds The bigger grape then Thanos The planet eater
It's not. Well, yes probably we won't see a Avengers movie again, but I think if Marvel is really planning Young Avengers old characters will appear. And come on, don't be sad because it's over, smile because it happened. ( but yes I'm depressed because Avengers is over. I hope MCU or Marvel never ends. )
Not depressed just a bit sad and glad that the main Avengers all had solid conclusions to their character arcs and looking forward to the future of the MCU because I unlike many think Endgame isn't the end of Marvel greatness I say there is still more to come and the Fantastic Four and X-Men will be a part of that
 @captainjakemerica4579   same if wolverine and the X-Men were in endgame we would have a better chance of killing Thanos
 @laytontex1  Idk about that once Thanos has the reality stone and the power stone he pretty much had the upper hand on just about anyone
 @captainjakemerica4579  I know
Yeah, but don't worry, now things get COLOSSAL, wait a few years and we'll be seeing galactus, beyonder, one above all, oblivion etc... all that on the cinema
 @victor_.  galactus is terrifying in Fortnite you only saw a little
Meee
Agree, I remember when I went to watch it live, it was just... MAGICAL
 @trxndesign3331  well I think your gonna get your wish the future looks bright
I remember thinking that, while I couldn’t wait to see it all, I was sad that there was nothing else to be excited about after. No more Avengers.
 @derekstark9062  Secret Wars, Fantastic 4, Guardians 3, Thor 4: Am I a joke to you?
OR IS IT ALL OVER
The Loki series: HELLO THERE
yes
Everyone saying they want galactus but I want nova and black bolt
Yep
im depresses dc aint have one
 @Jalen.3  I want every Marvel characters to come
 @leithal5096  That what they get when they tried to catch up with MCU
Yup.
It's only the start...
we're  depressed that your gone Kobe
Me
Not mcu only the infinity saga is over
No, I don't think someone needs to get depressed just because this is over. I'm actually happier now because I don't have to worry about spoilers anymore:)
 @michalblasko8740  dew it!
Who ever reads this you are beautiful and I love you and believe in yourself and it will get better 🧡
Don’t be sad because it’s over, smile because it happened.

Literally bro 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️
oh yes
I wouldn't be so sure lol there is going to be 6 avengers films we have more coming
Don't worry l bet the next 2 avengers movies will be far much greater than infinity war and endgame. But l can admit l am kinda depressed, but l am looking forward for 2025
Same. We went from Infinity War to the stuff we have today man.
More than I’ll ever be

Man I hate 2022 bring me back to 2018 and 2019

Yep. Good old days.
There is nothing left...
 @tahlon8200  It won't be the same
 @lrshafted1283  ok but really? Iron man died marvel is decaying I don't think they have the quality to do this again
I've been watching Marvel since childhood
Over? Just wait until Secret Wars! 😂😂
If marvel didn't make the endgame, marvel could have still keep going and be famous. But after making the endgame, I feel like all the films have gotten worse and boring😢
 @noahclark7603   aye aye god bless the infinity saga
Yes and i am the 16k like
What is over?????
Yes
Yep
😢
Yeah 😢
Very, the hype for it was massive, and the brutal ending made a much larger hype for endgame these years were good
No, I’m very sure Marvel will bring some awesome bangers in the future.
Yes man. Iam
 @kshitijisasare8635  why
Marvel used to serious back then, Now Every new Movie/Series of it is f**king joke ...
​ @trxndesign3331 this aged well...

the best trailer ever.
 @alphanerd7221  haha not even close.
 @jeffsavilleproductions7358  Pretending to laugh is what stupid people do in reaction to something you wish you could refute but can't.
 @alphanerd7221  yep you got me
Today mcu is terrible :(
 @alphanerd7221  generally speaking outside of maybe Ant-Man the quality of the newer movies and stories since Endgame haven’t honestly been the greatest. The only really decent films since then have been Shang-Chi, NWH and Quantumania. Everything else has seemed subpar at best. But, GotG3 comes out tomorrow, we’ll see if it changes the game.
 @thesovietvorona1007  No. The quality is consistent. You got fooled by the structure of narrative. That chapter 1 isn't as exiting and cathartic as a final chapter doesn't make it not as good. Endgame isn't even in my top 5. No Way Home is much better than Endgame and almost as good as Winter Soldier. It's not like Incredible Hulk is any better than Love and Thunder. 

Also, you took half the movies and said they were sub par. That is mathematically as it should be to maintain consistent quality.
 @alphanerd7221  take a look at Eternals. Expected to be a big wonderful blockbuster of an MCU film made like never before. Yet it has to be the worst thing out of the MCU since Dark World. Shoot, I’d rather watch the 1970s Spider-Man ten times over than watch that. Love and Thunder although funny was not a movie I’d watch more than once, maybe twice in my entire life. I only like Thor becoming a dad. Outside of that the movie was a joke.
 @thesovietvorona1007  Who expected that? I fully expected Eternals to suck. The comic always sucked. 

 Love and Thunder is a great movie that utilizes devices uneducated movie goers don't understand.
​ @thesovietvorona1007  I think there's 2 issues with the MCU at the moment.
1. They're being pushed to release the movies as early as possible
2. They're all trying to be more intense than endgame
In the phase after the climax of the previous saga, the intensity needs to drop back down. Think about the phase 1 movies, none of them were a giant quest to save the universe from an invincible threat. Most were small, personal conflicts. Those types of conflicts make the most sense to me for origin stories. In most phase 4 movies, they're trying to be bigger and more intense than what was supposed to be the climax of the MCU. And it feels kind-of weird how a lot of the villains appear out of no-where.
​ @alphanerd7221  wtf
 @santiagofarias4586  Your ignorance isn't my problem.
 @ninjanolan2391  "Think about the phase 1 movies, none of them were a giant quest to save the universe from an invincible threat."

Avengers, First Avenger, Thor. 

Ant-Man 3 was about people trying to escape. It hints at the world being in danger later but all that is at stake in it is the characters.
​ @alphanerd7221  ​ I quite liked Ant Man 3, I think it was one of the better ones of the new phases. 

Avengers is the climactic team-up of every character from the preceding phase, but even it stays small in comparison to later movies like Endgame. The events focus mainly on what Loki's doing on Earth, which is what's most important to the plot. Most of the film is not massive battles, but character development. 

As for Captain America and Thor, each conflict stays relevant to the characters. Thor is mainly focused on Thor's internal conflict, as well as the external conflict with his brother.

Captain America is about a noble person who works his way up from not being respected by most people, to being the figurehead for his country. The movie starts out small and takes its time to work its way to any large conflict. It too, stays focused mainly on character development.

I think what separated the MCU from other superhero movies at the time, was that it portrayed the heroes as people. It focused on characters first, action second.
 @ninjanolan2391  You are flailing.
 @thesovietvorona1007  Guardians of the Galaxy 3 was awesome! A nice sign off for James Gunn, terrific trilogy of movies
 @alphanerd7221  it's declining. No one's laughing. Ppl lie numbers don't lie.
 @jaimeruiz521  Well the numbers say it's more popular than ever. You lose.
 @alphanerd7221  your momma
 @jaimeruiz521  Well the numbers say it's more popular than ever. You lose.
 @thesovietvorona1007  it did gotg3 is top teir🙏
And now we have She-Hulk...... lol
​ @alphanerd7221  You're one of those people who think their opinions are the only ones that matter aren't you
 @theautomator8372  This isn't about opinions. You are one of those people that calls facts you don't like opinions.
 @mishimuddin  You are the one trying to pick a fight, and I'm not talking about a company.
 @alphanerd7221  well let’s try this, What phase 4 movies did you think was good, and why
I actually gotta do an essay in the trailer soo
 @jerryanderson1245  I particularly like Shang-Chi. It had great fight choreography and the comic relief and plot were well done. No Way Home is probably the best Spider-Man movie ever made. It's wall to wall great acting performances and great character driven action. Love and Thunder is a fantastic use of the unreliable narrator device to tell what would otherwise be a grueling story about grieving.
It’s a shame what has occurred to the mcu from this moment
​ @alphanerd7221  nope phase 4 been trash
 @mikethepokemaster2012  Write better if you want to pretend to have valid opinions about narrative.
Aaaaaaaaaannnd its WOKE
Пик MCU и сейчас нормальный
 @alphanerd7221 I’m sorry but no. Love and thunder was a shitty movie and didn’t even feel like a real thor movie. Thank god Taika isn’t coming back. Never thought they could do worse than dark world but they did. Bale was heavily underutilized. This guy was supposed to be killing gods and he kidnaps the kids of gods?? There are so many things wrong with that movie
 @earlvaughan-williams3835  Your feelings aren't important to me and you haven't come up with anything wrong with that movie. 

"Bale was heavily underutilized."


Total BS.
How you know ??
I don't get it, how do people expect the same sort of intensity in new marvel movies when the old characters are going away because the actors themselves are moving on, and the storylines themselves are being worn out creatively speaking? Of course at this point they need new characters in order to keep the ideas and such going
​ @alphanerd7221 in your dreams mate
 @biggerbertis989  You are mad at me for winning an argument.
Can you explain me at 2:01 how hulk in the back
​ @many029s  simple plain reason in one line:

IT WENT WOKE AND BECAME M-SHE-U THANKS TO DISNEY
Hehe
Don't call me out like that😂😭
@alphanerd7221  bro never heard of sarcasm
@alphanerd7221  weirdly just got the notification now. Weird. alphanerd read the edit.

Anyways  I love how I never said anything about facts. You just put words in my mouth. I asked a question, and instead of answering, you throw words into my mouth.

Out of morbid curiosity. What did you think of Guardians 3?


Edit 7/26/2023: This is an Edit to alphanerd. Simply put, he declared he won an argument and then blocked me so that I couldn't respond to him again. I just wanted to say that Alphanerd... you haven't won anything. You can't simply declare you've won, then block the person you apparently beat. That is extremely childish and honestly kind of pathetic. I'd also like to point out that you say that thor Love and Thunder was the worst performing movie in both phases 4 and 5, even though that's simply untrue. Antman 3 cost over 200 million to make with at least 100 million in marketing. It made 475 million. It needed to make at least 600 million to break even. You also say Shazam 2, making 100 million means it's a success, but you completely ignore the fact that it cost 125 million to make along with around 105 million in marketing. That movie failed. 

But truth be told, I don't know why I bother. You're too much of a loser to ever admit when you are wrong, and you'll simply block everyone who doesn't automatically agree with you like the 5 year old you are. Grow up, kid. Peace
 @theautomator8372  You are mad at me for winning an argument.
Guys stop this was please.
 @theautomator8372  You are mad at me for winning an argument.
@alphanerd7221  you can't just declare you've won an argument. If anything it shows how childish you are. Grow up.
How did yk
​ @alphanerd7221  No need to refute something completely false
 @theautomator8372  You are mad at me for winning an argument.
​ @Affasss terrible is a stretch
​ @alphanerd7221 Hell no.
 @seanbreslin4938  Facts crap on your feelings.
 @alphanerd7221   What numbers are you using-- by every numerical metric I'm seeing, Marvel has underperformed expectations/not broken even on any phase 4 or phase 5 film except Shang Chi and Spiderman no way home. And you saying you won an argument means nothing, especially when you gave no evidence anywhere. Furthermore, public opinion seems to be souring on superheroes altogether (see the box office results of every superhero movie this year), I would argue a product of a deep sense of worthlessness and nihlism which has infected the West.
 @AVB2419  Well you aren't looking at any legitimate ,metrics. Every MCU movie has been wildly profitable. Disney+ brought in over 7 Billion last year and pretty much all that is because of the MCU. 

"public opinion seems to be souring on superheroes altogether (see the box office results of every superhero movie this year)"

I've seen them, and they prove that Super hero movies are wildly popular. Bringing non MCU movies into an argument about MCU movies shows that you know you lost the argument. Shazam 2 making over 100 million after the franchise being cancelled shows that super hero movies are very popular. If you look up the MCU movies by box office phase one has all the lowest box office movies. The lowest one from phase 4 and 5 is Love and Thunder which made over 700 million. That means it was hugely popular at the box office even though it was released during a pandemic. 

You lose.
Secret wars will blow this out of the water
​ @alphanerd7221  this nerd is going nuts.
​ @alphanerd7221 DAMN BUD. What kind of Copium gas you been smelling?
Can I have some?
Need that copium to cope on other shows and not wasted on the MCU.
🖤
 @peternguyen4211  Typical millennial reaction to facts you want to refute but can't.
Nah I accidentally opened the vid but nice assumption ig
Golden age of superheroes movies, excellent and inspiring writing, but as they say, down is the only way when you're at the top, eh?
Yes I am.
Phuk you man ;-; why you know that 

Im getting emotional thinking about what i felt and just how much was at stake at this point in time
Yes indeed me too this stuff is legendary I almost shed a couple of tears
yeahhh!!!!!!!!!
The best marvel movie and trailer ever
And in 5 yrs Marvel has turn to S***T Thats why love the trailers...I too have the feel
​ @waseeuddin9476  The Best Movie Trailer In Whole Hollywood ❤
Yesss
Miss this Era fr
Quickest 5 years of my life
 @yummyfishfiletmmm1535  it will only seem to get faster the more you age
its the best feeling when you still have the feels
The hulk
Yeah
 @yummyfishfiletmmm1535 only a matter of time before Kang dynasty comes out
ong, phase 3 was just insane imo, so perfect
Fr
Really wish I could go back to the time when I first watched this masterpiece
Realllllyyyy
Back when MCU movies didn't suck
Take some time mah man, it's just a beginning of the Kang dynasty
​​ @minakshidevi2331 eah when people will see how Kang dynasty comic story is built different then see the hype
​@minakshidevi2331 the hype is gone... once antman beat (the confirmed most dangerous version)... the mystique is sort of lost...
 @zahidrehman528  Was'nt even Antman, the real MVPs were those ants
Endgame shouldnt be mention in the same sentence as Infinity war.
For me Infinity war is in the league of its own while Endgame is still amazing but barely a top 5 mcu movie
Infinity war >>>>>>>>> everything else
Civil war better
i think kang dynasty and secret wars will be the best marvel movies ever made
secret wars and kang dynasty might be better
 @Verdethegreat  I sure hope so. With Marvel constantly doing bad on their movies lately, besides GOTG3 and NWH, I really hope the same doesn't happen to Kang Dynasty and Secret Wars. Because those are 2 huge movies that you CANNOT mess up.
 @viceregaldust3191  I agree. Gotg 3 was the only good movie since NWH. The marvels looks promising. but kang dynasty and secret wars Need to be good. can't mess it up cause they will be the 2 biggest movies in the MCU.
Spiderman 2 was better. But infinity war is second
 @KcKnightX  I can respect that. Spider-Man 2 is definitely in my Top 5. To this day, it is still a masterpiece.
we needed some more hulk but other then that this one hell of a movie put everyone in awe just by how great it was.
Nah,the fact that Valkyrie was supposed to be in it and couldn’t be is just sad,the movie would have been better if she’s in it
deadpool 1 trailer, this trailer, ,the transformers trailers...., even the fast movies... your right hype is gone when referring to movies
This movie should be goated
 @aaronbwali3766  It IS goated.
 @major9307 they’ll most likely be rushed.
Spiderverse movies>
Well, when I watched this movie I was completely blown away.
I have never watched a movie of this quality. 
I only watched on my computer and not in the theater. But despite that I have never enjoyed a movie that much in the theater as I enjoyed by watching it on my computer.
Other movies I enjoyed a lot is Marvel: Endgames, Logan, Ragnarok and Star Wars: Revenge of the sith.
But Infinity War is number one.
 @hsafootballworld1321  BRUH I Also Had a Similar Experience! Infinity War was the 1st Marvel Movie I Saw in Theatres, and It was an Experience!
Really appreciate your kindness in appreciating everyone 🤝🤝
Exactly
the hype was just unreal
Yeah
I watched it while I was grounded
I will disagree with that but I can see where you’re coming from
This movie is amazing and objectively better than Endgame but I still prefer it over Infinity War
Exactly 💕
i actually hated endgame with my first viewing, infinity war had the best tone while endgame reversed all of it to be funny
 @koolerpure  Yeah I was pretty meh on the movie during the first chunk of it.  Specially fat Thor.  The concept isn’t a problem, it’s how they handled it.  Either way this movie is the best MCU movie so yeah
I enjoyed endgame more
Agree
Endgame is amazing
IW ftw
Agreed, infinity war was way better.
For real! It's the reason why I'm a big fan of the MCU :)
Nah I think the first viewing of end game was better but don't get me wrong I think infinity war was the better of the 2 cause it was the first MCU movie were the good guys lose
So tru I remember when I went to the cinema with da boys and we went to the Mac afterwards and talked about our favorite moments😔🙏
Yes
Yes
Endgame ya overrated
I liked both infinity war and endgame, I hate the blue monkey film ooh avatar I lost the word right there!!
 @surabhi.yashupalrao1693  😑
Facts
True
Yeah! Not first time..everytime!
Yes
 @teaketchup1296  bruh , you r complaining about endgame ? I know it ended sadly but the story , concept , no one thought about time travel . I still think endgame is better
Emad Raza trust me it's worth watching !
Samuel Rojas Jaramillo nothing can beat - Christian bale and heath performance in dark knight🙄🙄
 @surabhi.yashupalrao1693  when you try to be funny:
Everything is like heaven 
Evry and each movie of avengers is priceless incredible diamond for world
True af
Infinity war was sooooo much better imo was better in every way
Very true
Same film. Shot Back-to-Back.... just not released as 1 (as that would cross over 6 Hours Duration)😄
Facts especially when the opening theme came on
TRUE
I treat endgame as a continuation of IW, technically they're one film
I honestly was more hyped for Endgame
The dark knight is so better
Yeah, alot of people tried to spoil it (I heard about the ending, they were lucky when I misunderstood them about the infinity stones
On God? Oh I know, it’s just that I really liked the Thor from Infinity War and I would have preferred him.  Also to address all other comments, Endgame is my favorite movie of all time and the best MCU movie.  I’m just pointing out some stuff I didn’t like
True
Yeah but the hype for endgame was just something else! Unmatchable!
I saw it multiple times in two different states lol
Yeah 
Sheeeeeeeeeeesh
nothing compared to endgame imo
Agreed
I understand
The whole movie was spoiled for me by that one annoying girl who just can’t shut up
 @wosany  sorry to hear man <:( some dick posted the full movie synopsis on Facebook and spoiled it for me the day before I went to see it
And it was because of Thanos entry
 @Tomchas  thank you!
No, no you are absolutely right.
Ong
should have ended with this one . Time travel is just lazy writing
Coughs Doctor strange 2
Endgame was a decent film, but Infinity War is more than the best superhero film ever made; it's among the best films ever made.
Factos!!!
 @michaelbaxter1564  until doctor strange 2
True...
That's Wright
Facts. Top 3 MCU film for sure; definitely better than Endgame.
Dude end game it's just an extension of Infinity war, so that's why although the end game has the best battle of the entire saga, Infinity causes an indescribable feeling, my favorite Marvel movie by far
Endgame was overrated imo
Well the thing is end game was more of a blast from the past while infinity was focused on the now ! 
Which makes both movies completely different 
Ima have to say infinity war reigns over endgame by a razor thin decision
Me when reading this: I guess
Me having seen NWH: Objection!!!
💯💯💯💯💯
I remember the first time seeing infinity war in the cinema it was one of the best experience ive had.
Yes
SULLI CHEEKU
Couldn’t agree more
You're right bro
True dat
well said
I agree it never gets old
True
Bro why would we get you wrong you are saying right I still remember how excited I was for watching infinity war
Youre right
Totally agree with you 😌
Yes bro
Infinity War was a better film in my opinion, but the buildup and payoff of Endgame was what made it great
Yes
Agreed it was something else entirely
 @teaketchup1296  the Endgame hype is totally based on the success of infinity war
cough cough 😷 Spider man no way home
Said it before and will say it again. Infinity war broke the mould for a superhero film. Killing off half the heroes at the end and making the heroes lose? Never been done before to my knowledge. And it is this coupled with some great scenes (the fight in wakanda, the fight on titan, gamora being killed for the soul stone). Overall one hell of a movie. But too many people say how they prefer infinity war or endgame. They have the same film. Yes they were released separately, but they are meant to be watched together so in my opinion they need to be referred to as a single film.
Haaa exactly
God it was so incredible when those lights went dim and the Asgardian distress call played
True
 @cyansus8317  yeah it is
Hell yeach
 @leena1317  Hype for both movies was giantic
No one is taking u wrong. Definitely not me
And in IMAX 3D on release date
 @cyansus8317  "no one thought about time travel" LMAO it's the most overused concept in science fiction. Not to mention Endgame had way too many flaws in its concept, it tried to be too smart
But i like the endgame more exactly when falcon says on you left and everyone come through the portal
Yea
and the pure silence that fell when the credits started to roll...
Totally agree
I wish I could rewatch this without knowing what happens.
You are right man
Endgame is the best but Infinity War was way more than that
I don’t really agree, there was a ton of hype in the theater when this came out, but it still doesn’t beat the feeling of that final scene in endgame.
 @leena1317  facts
infinity war is superior
The first few days of Infinity War's premiere weren't just a movie, it was an event. I'm not sure any movie premiere will ever feel the same.
Exactly
Emad Raza Worth watching? They are the best movies ever made
Especially Thor's entry to wakanda
Exactly
AGREE
Cheers to that bro 🥳
I like infinity war better but endgame was a better experience
Infinity War was the superior film just because we didn't know what to expect in endgame we already knew how it was going to be, not the whole thing but we had the theories
True.
💯
No
Used to have endgame as my fav, but now infinity war is my fav.
as if it matters but i stopped watching MCU movies after age of ultron but than i watched ragnarok.... which was an amazing movie and then i watched infinity wars..... hands down guns down the whole world down..... this is the best superhero movie of all time...... man amazing movie overall with memorable individual moments.... actually endgame was good but it reaped the rewards because infinity war was such an amazing movie...i would call myself lucky if i live long enough to experience the same cinematic pleasure again in my life ... gosh i can write so much more
IW is easily the best MCU movie
 @teaketchup1296  Well then you're wrong. IW was the better movie in almost every way.
 @aryankaushik93  Nice joke.
 @Hotshotuk85  Yeah it's a fact.
 @bestlaptop_psn  thanks.
It's a better movie.
MAYBE
Emad Raza yesss
Fr
'Captain Marvel' is the Worst Marvel Movie Ever.... 👍🏻
I prefer infinity war to endgame
Totalmente de acuerdo
The dead silence in the theater as everybody left was bar none
Fr!!
Totally agree. Portal scene was just epic, but Infinity War had this emotional weight that never fades.
Yeah coz we were not prepared for it.
Hii
 @teaketchup1296  no way home would like a word with u
Agreed
I’m definitely in the camp of Infinity War was better than Endgame. Not a popular opinion from what I’ve seen but so be it.
100% the better movie of the two
 @cyansus8317  took to long to get to the point, if they were to take out 1 hour of that movie. Would have been better
Facts!!
Correct
I wish I had a time machine
So true
Yes
Infinity war was all full of action
Yep
That is true my friend
Facts
Seriously!
I agree
Except that climaxe battle end game will be considered as a waste... 
But infinity war was not like that💥💥💥💯⚡❤❤❤😍🥰😍
Yes sir!
omg facts, i think this is the best trailer for any mcu project adding to the fact the hype around it
Touché
 @surabhi.yashupalrao1693  WITHOUT AVATAR BOTH OF MOVIES INFINITY WAR AND ENDGAME CANT BE MADE
Still remember the day that I screaming sooooo hard
I wish Marvel would get back to this... I miss this feeling.
Y
secret wars will be even better
But then when we find out what happens at the end
 @briank1263  wait for secret wars
Ong
Yeah infinity war was very nice Excellent
I felt the same my man I totally agree with ya
Yessssss
Both Endgame And Infinity War Are Best
Thats so genuine 😊
Meanwhile with Secret wars...
Endgame was trash
Well that was 1st time we were going to experience the legendaryness of the franchise
For real bro !
fr
Endgame can never match Infinity war.
The hype of seeing all the characters interact with eachother was crazy. Good times
Ong
Tbh I honestly enjoyed Infinity War so much more!
ikr
It's impossible to disagree from you.
Yep nobody was ready for emotions we were going ti through for this film.
Seriously! The excitement for watching Thanos being a badass was at another level.
the hype of this film was actualy intense and you are exactly right
Endgame is a great movie, but "infinity war" is the ceiling of the marvel universe.
Fav Avengers Movie of all time ❤️
 @wolverine8635  yes it is
Idk avengers assemble and the hammer flying to cap was way too hype
And then there’s Spider-Man No Way Home
True
💯💯💯💯❤️👍
100% agree, especially this of us who had to see each film in the franchise. I apologize if this has already been stated, but I didn’t read through any comments.
Yeah plus endgame was too long
This trailer hits different though
I know....
Agreed!
Surprisingly, I am a new Marvel fan and I am watching it soon. This comment gets me exited
couldnt agree more
Nah endgame was so much more hype the first time I saw it
But for me 
Endgame>infinity war
Yaa that's right
Frfr
I saw the movie high and 3D I felt like I was one of the avengers watching their friends die
Totally agree. Infinity war is classic
Still mad he never said in the movie “fun isn’t something one considers when balancing the universe…..”
Infinity war was an once in a life time Master piece.
Opening night was a night many of us 90s kids dreamed of as children watching xmen cartoons.
Something about infinity war just hit different. Maybe it was the darker tones and the culmination  of so many storylines leading to this one moment ? Best of marvel to me
 @Papajohn69  infinity war is much better than endgame
Especially the first time
That's freaking TRUE....
I agree Infinity war is one of them rare movies you wish you could watch for the first time again
Infinity war have more action scenes and had another feeling but only somebody who watched all of the movies in mcu and is a real fan only then you will realise the feeling of Endgame.Endgame isn't a movie it is a feeling
❤
OK
FACTS!!!
Because if there is no infinity war there will no endgame....
Correct
Agreed
Facts pure facts
Literally their magnum opus
Or for a second time for each
But now the MCU is gonna change forever for when Avengers The kang Dynasty and Avengers secret wars come out in 2025
Kang dynasty and secret wars might change that ngl
I miss that feeling
I agree with everything, except Endgame beign awesome.. it was horrible...
Agreed
 @sakshamrao6581  no
Exactly bro , I agree 🔥❤️
overrated joke fest LMAOO
Seing FOR THE FIRST TIME all of your favorite héroes, Is heartachign
Yesssssss
From beginning to end my nerves was shot
Agree 👍🔥🔥😘
Nothing will beat endgame
This movie tops quality The Dark Knight,s Nolan, but is bigger and more ambicious.
Honestly you’re right 😢
Thats a fact
Yes bro
Agreed.  Infinity war was the empire strikes back, to endgames return of the Jedi.
 @vinayvats4004  who’s talking about that?
 @sakshamrao6581  again we’re talking about infinity war and endgame here not the dark knight
In my opinion, Infinity War was better than Endgame
True that.
Exactly!
Agree with you. Avengers:Infinity war is a freaking amazing movie the first you saw it theaters
Don't get me wrong but you don't know what makers can do if done correctly 🔥💯
Both was awesome
 @samuraixd3919  I hope they remember you.
Yep
That’s what I’m saying
Same
This comment does put a smile on my face.
Yep
You you have brought balance to the universe with this message my great lord
De hecho Infinity wars me gusto mas que endgame
Infinity War was a masterpiece though. Endgame was good but not on the same quality as Infinity War.
I think Infinity War was better because we all knew the Avengers will win, but we were wrong. It took away everything we knew and loved.

Then for Endgame we had hope for their survival and win
Yeah
esp in IMAX
E X A C T L Y
Trye
Once in a lifetime feeling.
Infinity war>Endgame
 @dominoxbelovaxv177  always
Did u forget the last scenes(moments)
 @nargisrahimjonova8770  point
Fr
That's totally true ♾️⚠️
 @koolerpure  nope...watch it in different perspective...both movies are part of same...endgame is just extended version nothing else...

Obviously endgame's cap lifting hammer and avengers assemble scenes are better than any other movies ..
Cap completed his dance...Tony met his father...Thor met his mom...

And all little throwbacks towards previous mcu were quite nice...also endgame Thanos was way brutal than this one...

Endgame was perfect culmination of 23 interconnected MCU movies
Staresrd
Truee
Endgame for spoiled for me so I definitely enjoy infinity war more
💯 still watching it and the trailer
That feeling of hopelessness after the snap juxtaposed with the feeling of power when those portals opened.
They were both perfect. I cried for both.
Yes bruh
🥺💯
Infinity was a masterpiece imo. Endgame was just a continuation.
Neither films would of worked without each other, so I think they are potentially equal, however the hype built up for endgame made endgame just epic.
Avengers  Infinity War was absolutely   superior!
Couldn’t agree more!
Dam right, still my second marvel movie, second only to winter soldier...both are Russo directed....I watch this trailer once a week
Yeah
Been saying this forever
glad to be alive man those 2021 will remember Forever
IW is the best Marvel movie. No one thought thanos would win at first in IW but in Endgame we knew heroes would win no matter what.
Facts!
Thor coming into Wakanda was the greatest moments of television for me.
Nah, nothing will ever beat the feeling of the Portal scene at the end and Tony's snap.
Exactly!
Endgame was less than average
Thank you.
Infinity war was the best show ever
FINALLY SOMEONE WHO GETS IR
Same here. I think its cos we all knew the what was to come...
🤣🤬 ye ye 🤬
 @koolerpure  I felt that endgame was kinda slow and wanna be emotional in the stafing but the end fight balanced it all
Bro like why would they make everyone die like bro…
I still haven't seen it
 @yoko-tanaka  the hell dude
 @japjitbakshi6435  😭 I count on seeing it one day, but there are a LOT of marvel movies that I haven't seen
hell yeah!!
No bull
FR
exactly
esp the trailer
You have stolen my feelings bro 😭🔥
Endgame was still more hype
The day I cried on my birthday 😢
IW being the better movie (and not just by a little bit, either) is a hill I'm happy to die on.
Endgame sucks, infinity war is millions time better
We are on the same page fam it was so hype
Coming up on 5 years. 👏
Totally agree bro🎉
Bcz that's the first time we witnessed Thanos on screen, the mentality and his attitude the way he came alone, that made everyone mad. That's why it's crazier than end game. But endgame has its seperate fanbase 💖💯
True that
Both are incredibly amazing movies but personally I've hated endgame the most, because of the obvious reasons, they could've done anything rather than killing iron man.
 @teaketchup1296  infinity wars was the first movie that lead me into becoming a marvel fan. endgame was great and a satisfying and sad ending but you can definitely sense a bunch of plot holes and things that didn't make sense in the movie.
Yes
Xd
 @teaketchup1296  goofy
 @koolerpure  cry
 @teaketchup1296  cry
Hm
Agree
Well packed direction
What an en edit
 @teaketchup1296 feel the same. Think it’s because they win in end game. As great as IW is it’s a low note throughout
I've been watching Marvel since childhood
Yeahh. Infinity War was the best MCU movie.
I whole heartedly agree with this statement.
Ong
Factual
🔥🔥🔥 once in lifetime
Same for civil war
Tell me about it
Word
💯
I said the same thing my fav avengers movie hands down
Totally it's way better it has all the action, basically all the characters and the collect of the stones ❤❤❤
pew pew
 @teaketchup1296  Well then you're wrong. Plain and simple.
Well then, it seems that quite a number of you are upset with me due to my statements.  I’d like to clarify that even 2 years later from the original comment, I still prefer Endgame over Infinity War.  However, this is purely subjective, as I understand the plotting in Endgame is quite terrible due to the mere existence of time travel.  The borderline assassination of Thanos and  Thor are also factors that have negatively affected my objective and subjective view of this movie.  I have also come to appreciate Infinity War a lot more, mainly due to the excellence of the character development in our heroes and the character building of Thanos.  Finally, I’d like to retract my claim of Endgame being the best marvel movie.  Even in the MCU, there are better written, actually sensical offerings to enjoy.  Have a good day.
I second that
Amen
Exactly
The hype was so much better for Endgame I'd rather see Endgame for the first time than Infinity War
 @jonoxd1155  man I think the hype was more real for infinity war. And the ending of infinity war was so good that’s why it made you hype for endgame lol but infinity hit harder to me than endgame did.
Ur so right bruh. Infinity war is the best movie ever made by MCU.
Bro you weren't there opening night avengers endgame. That was literally peak of humanity
I liked Endgame the most, and as a critic, I’d say Endgame is better, considering the nostalgia and culmination of 22 connected films. But when it comes to more action, Infinity War has upper hand.
 @Dub4Fun  Same… I got the most excited in finale
 @imsnare  it is
 @dushanthasadaruwan1880  Infinity War’s dark tone made Endgame the peak of the MCU (imo, some may not agree and that’s fine)
Fr
Endgame was not awesome, infinity war was
My sentiment exactly.
Totally agree!
Fr
I see where ya coming from, but that End Game fight,  the emotions involved with Cap and throwing, and catching the Thor hammer was epic. When the portals opened....Wooooo!
This is 2023..amd you are 100% correct
since then I still clearly remember the hero who freed the captives
Watching it the first time was jaw dropping
Correct
FR!!
True
Yep🙂
Absolutely right🎉
​ @leena1317 true
We shouldnt even combine both I mean both are on different levels but yesh Infinty War in terms of suspense and sadness and seeing sll superheros lost for the first time was just phenomonal work on the movie.
i need to tell you one thing....there...was an idea
Noo, they should never have made the endgame, infinity war was the perfect ending for me
😢
I strongly concur
Soooo true
Just my personal opinion but I think my reaction to Endgame was even greater. Both were hyped af and I was all in for it. The end battle in Endgame starting with the trio and then the portals and the assemble, cannot be beaten though.
Complete roller coaster of feelings and sides... Avengers and Thanos
Watching those closing scenes of Infinity War make my hair raise and send goosebumps all down my body. The hopelessness is so palpable… Hell, the opening scenes of Endgame felt even more hopeless, quite honestly. 

And, I’ll say Endgame could’ve definitely been improved if the Russo’s had studied The Battle of The Bastards & The Battle of Helm’s Deep. That was the only thing was missing. They Crip Walked across the finish line instead, and I don’t blame them, they totally deserve it, and I loved the on screen inclusion they went for, too. But, that was the only area that left something to be desired.
Thor's entrance in Wakanda in the movie theatre was absolutely chaotic. The whole place was screaming so loud
Endgame is a 6/10 
Infinity War is a 11/10
Yep
Absolutely right
I fr miss the hype for infinity war
Agreed 100%
Lol🤣
right
Glad we all feel the same.
Me too ❤
Yeah it’s not a bored movie 😊😊
​ @SN1638 what??
I have watched this movie more than 50 times
This movie and endgame i can watch a billion times and not get bored
Hye could you please tell me that how can I get to watch the last scene of this trailer where all Avengers are running through forest 😿😢🥹🥹 I'm from India and I've trying to find that scene still in 2023.... Plzz tell me
⁠​⁠​⁠ @THORFANCLUB832 this Scene is only in the trailer ,they added it to make the trailer more exiting
Fr I watched it like 6 times and I'm rewatching all 4 I'm on Endgame now
 @THORFANCLUB832  Yeah if you look in the background of that part you can see hulk but he wasn’t in that point of the movie.
Me too, Thor is the best written here
Truee ❤️❤️
Pretty sure the whole world saw this in theatres lol
I don’t think there will ever be a movie more hyped up than IW and EG
Phase 4 was bad but it looks like it is becoming good again like GOTG 3, Spiderman NWH, Spiderman ATSV, Moon knight, Wanda Vision, Loki 1, Secret Invasion, The Marvels, Deadpool 3 and there is literally soooo much more good stuff up coming
 @Chaos.-  I think the problem is that there's so much coming out...not only it is almost impossible to keep track, but also some shows/movies are very underwhelmingly made, boring and failed attempts at comedy, such as Thor 4...what happened to this all mighty norse god? But yeah, GOTG 3 was by far the best production in the last few years, so was Loki and What If...
 @Chaos.-  I've lost interest in marvel , as have a lot of people 
personally ill only watch up to endgame (not counting captain marvel) it might as well be finished in my opinion
 @Rowant-sh7vm  Yeah, this means you're not a Marvel fan
 @Chaos.-  no its just not what it used to be , I find its focusing too much on identity politics to tell good stories anymore , captain marvel may be the strongest avenger but she's go less personality than groot. she hulk thinks she had a harder life than Bruce because she gets catcalled a couple times despite the fact that in avengers assemble its revealed he's tried to commit suicide and during endgame had to lose his close friend and love interest of Natasha , even if you wanted a traumatized female character story they don't go far enough with it to make her believable like tell a heavy story about implied domestic abuse or rape/sexual assault if you want us to feel really sorry about a character. if not don't try at all as it comes off cheap
ever heard of shrek 5?
 @hayden2283  no
Subhojit Bhar 😮
Hayden no because it doesn’t exist...






Yet
 @genesis4238  but this one was better it was hype
Blue Milk so true
Except for the second trailer
The Dark Knight had a infinitley better trailer.
U sure about that
nah Endgame
 @rassingh8185  So infinitely good it put me to sleep three times. TDK is crap.
Blue Milk captain America civil the one that introduced Spider-Man
This movie hyped up end game
The force awakens
 @jarrettwhitlow8700  The movie or the trailer? You cannot physically say TDK movie was crap. Arguably the best superhero film of all time, one of the best films every. This is coming from someone whose favorite movie is IW btw.
what is tdk anyway? Marvel is the number one.
Jurassic world 3 finale would
Justice League: Hold up

Marvel: f*ck no
Endgame-hold my beer
Endgame
Hayden: Endgame trailer?
 @jarrettwhitlow8700  It's one of the best movies ever created according to most critis. Just stop being deluded you fanboy. I don't even like DC.
 @vie3147  The Dark Knight.
Rehaan Aamir No it is not. It is good but no way near the best. It is not even the best Marvel film. Logan is better than Endgame.
Blue Milk endgame
Endgame: on your left
 @jarrettwhitlow8700  TDK is one of the best movies ever made the soundtrack cinematography editing acting action scenes and acting are all impeccable and don't even get me started on heath ledgers performance as the joker. But you are aloud your own opinion so if you think it sucks that's fine
Top 8's mad respect
Rehaan Aamir I mean you cannot argue quality in films by using an objective point. So for you subjectively endgames the best
 @jarrettwhitlow8700  Dude, saying TDK is crap is a crime, but tbh it put me to sleep too lol
 @hayden2283  no..i dont want to either
 @gabepark1513  I have noticed none of this "impeccability" you talk about, any of the times I have watched it.
 @jarrettwhitlow8700  well that's your opinion then but I'm pretty sure your one of the only people that thinks that
 @gabepark1513  If you say so. Infinity War blows it out of the water.
Joker
Blue Milk true
 @CW-mi1gp  that's an opinion. TDK was trash imo
- Jxmes not introduce him they added him to the mcu
Rehaan Aamir Endgame is highly overrated. It was good, but the work they did on a lot of characters was very disappointing.
 @Ok-eg8dg  Finally you've arrived Batman to sort these fanboys out.
Ex
C W it’s crap in my opinion I couldn’t watch it fully the first time took me like two days to finish it
Endgame...
Endgame
 @rassingh8185  No where near the best

Box office:
Sips beer
Maybe this or endgame
No the force awakens trailer did to
Except the Endgame
true
Exactly! And deliver the way that it did
Avengers endgame: I'm gonna wreck this man's whole career!
I remember watching it in my school's computer lab 
It had 40 million views in just 22 hours
And when I saw it, as you said earlier
We all were hyped
Iron man 3 had a good trailer , “you’ll never see me coming”
Ever heard of endgame?
Agreed
cough cough Harry Potter Deathly Hallows
What about endgame ?
Best trailer ever
 @rassingh8185  What is "The Dark Knight"????




Never hear of It.
I swear the people arguing against it just look at the views, it speaks for itself no trailer exceeds the hype of this one
Blue Milk Avengers cough endgame
joker
Blue Milk you heard of endgame
C W He can say it was crap since its his opinion even though I disagree and like the film. Its all subjective.
DoubleFailMech Most people think Endgame is the best film ever made and it has higher critic ratings than the dark knight, does that make it better to you? Its subjective and always will be
 @jordanwebster1728  facts
I think it surpassed it, seeing that no one hated this movie like what happened with Avengers 2
that is an absolute fact
 @rassingh8185  so the 2nd highest grossing movie of the year is not
 @rassingh8185  tdk sucked In my opinion
 @rx3la  yep
Days of future past trailer
 @rassingh8185  just like your grammer...
The Hype Was Insane
Jarrett Whitlow I’m sorry, but TDK is still better than every single MCU or DCEU movie, lol. The only movies that are close are the Winter Soldier And Infinity War, but they’re still inferior films.
cough Endgame cough cough
Vie the dark knight. You know, the movie that the people who worship it don’t know what opinions are? Yeah, that one.
Alex Romero ikr it was so boring
Luke Moran NO WAY THAT WAS HORRIBLE NOBODY WAS EXCITED
AJ to the M Didn’t people who worshipped Endgame threatened people who gave the movie bad reviews? And didn’t the fanboys beat up people because they spoiled the ending? Don’t give me that hypocritical bullshit dude, lol. The people who loved the Dark Knight at least don’t attack people because they spoiled something.
 @reneepeck8094  nostalgia... spiderman 2 is better than tdk spider verse is better than tdk gotg is better than tdk ironman 3 is better than tdk winter soldier and civil war is better than tdk infinity war is better than tdk and endgame is better than tdk.. no one is saying to accept the reality but atleast don't talk like moron simply doesn't wanna move on.. there was nothing special in tdk other than joker or you could tell me what makes it special? Than these movies
 @reneepeck8094  also one place we see character which are already established like batman joker superman and another you see ironman which no one knew about before 2008 still the dc fails to capture the very essence of the character yet you say marvel thrives because it has great characters!? Tdk was supposed to be a great antagonist movie which it is not a batman movie just like IW..
Game Bond Longevity doesn’t equal good dude. It doesn’t matter that the MCU has been going on for more than a decade if most of the films are mediocre. Should I also congratulate the Michael Bay Transformer movies now because they’ve been created since 2007? No, lol.
Game Bond Sorry, but the Dark Knight is still better. The story is better, the visuals are better, the music is better, the acting was better, the villains were better, etc. No comic book movie is better than the Dark Knight I’m sorry. Some are really close, but didn’t hit the nail.
 @reneepeck8094  if you get content better than its duration fullfilling everything in which people are invested with great development i dont even see whats so wrong... Just like tdk where batman's ark felt left out and so of others..
Game Bond This is going to be one of my last comments since it’s clear that we will not be on equal agreement. When I say that TDk has great acting, that doesn’t mean that Marvel doesn’t have any great acting. Robert Downey Jr did a fantastic job as Iron Man, but his acting isn’t as good as some like Ekhart, Ledger, or Bale. I will be honest and say that the only great acting performances in Endgame was Robert, Jeremy Renner, and Tom Holland. All the other acting performances were just decent or fine. In what part of any of my comments did I ever become one sided or acting like a fanboy? You’re the one who called me delusional and retarded because I only said that TDK is the best comic book movie ever made. Just because I think the MCU is overrated doesn’t mean that it doesn’t have its merits. The action scenes are great, the cgi (sometimes) are incredible, the acting is usually good, etc. I just think that the Dark Knight hits the nails at those points better than any Marvel or DC movie that has come as of late.
Game Bond I can be immersed in giant films like the MCU. I love the Lord of The Rings series because it’s an amazing epic, but since the MCU has made over 20 movies and only a few of them actually achieved the level of awesomeness as the Lord of The Rings.
It ruins the investment I have with these films and characters.
 @reneepeck8094  and the people you talked about having great performance no one can play cap other than chris evans such a legendary character.. But you wouldnt understand because you think civil was boring.. Honestly if i would have been bored of civil war than probabliy tdk would literally be the most boring movie for me.
Ever heard of joker?
Endgames bro
Endgame trailer: am I a joke to u?
Yea its good but others have been really good also
Joker : “send in the clowwwwwwwns.”
I agree but this movie made me so sad
Minecraft
Not even endgame
Joker : Hold my Negative Thoughs
Joker trailer: Hold my sanity
Joker trailer is way better
In my opinion I’m very excited for joker
Dam right 👍
 @hayden2283  lol
 @subhojitb.433  just Savage lol
Can you introduce me as Joker?
 @sean-thiago1986  nah
What about the first Avengers trailer
Until Avengers Endgame.
Avengers endgame would like to know you location
 @CW-mi1gp  the dark knight was definitely a stand alone n one of the best superhero movies but honestly not as gud as infinity war or endgame lol it just isnt
Renee Peck inferior films with better protagonist arcs imo.
Renee Peck dude, there are several people on the internet who think they’re philosophers for worshipping TDK but can’t understand quality is subjective and call people stupid for saying they don’t like something. Even when TDKR got bad reviews, Nolan fans threatened the critics as well. ALL fanboys are bad, marvel AND DC, TDK trilogy fanboys are toxic. Not one or the other. Tdk was never perfect to me, I like it a lot, but never thought it was a masterpiece since the protagonist greatly lacked for me, and Rachel wasn’t that good of a character at all.
Until endgame came lol
Yeah this is the only reason I watched all MCU movies
Blue Milk i agree
Infinity War: "In time, you will know what it's like to lose. Dread it, run from it, destiny arrives all the same."
Endgame: "Whatever it takes, whatever it takes, whatever it takes. Not us."
I feel like the dialogue speaks for itself regarding the better movie.
 @rassingh8185  Clears throat
You were saying?
ikr
Blue Milk endgame trailer: am I a joke to you?
Renee Peck not really. Thats your opinion but in mine, the dark knight had bad, like really bad combat scenes and batman lacked GREATLY as a protagonist. Even Harvey Dent was more interesting with his transition into Two-Face than Batman himself, and Rachel was just a plot device who cheated but claimed to love dent. Its not a masterpiece in every single way like people blindly praise imo
AJ to the M Yeah, so many people think they’re mature philosophers for praising that film but can’t understand quality is subjective and rage against those who dislike the film as if its a problem. All fandoms are toxic, TDK doesn’t get a pass.
Joker......????
In my opinion, infinity war better than endgame
 @rassingh8185  NO. JUST NO.
Fact
Blue Milk Ever Heard Of The Force Awakens?
 @user-nz8xj9be8y  No
batman and 90% of the dc fanbase seem to think the DCEU is for intellectuals and “mature” people
Because its darker even though BVS wasn’t as good as these “comedies”.
The clown thinks differently
Joker did for me personally.
Force awakens??
Agreed
Rise of Skywalker trailer already has lol
Top 8's nope
Julus Voge no
@Pakin 86 I really doubt that.
Not even endgame tbh
Blue Milk how bout the endgame trailer
I think star wars ep 7 could rival this
 @vie3147  you must be very young to not know what batman the dark night is
Avengers Endgame had 2 solid trailers
Am I the only one who still gets shivers while watching this?
 @vampcrush  nope
Age of ultron trailer was the best
cxntent     Definitely not even close
 @fergman9344  Yes very close
Cough cough endgame
Spider Man 4 - real one
You God daim right
Avemgers emdgane
Ever heard of JOKER
Endgame did 😅
@Blue Milk ... The Dark Knight had an epic trailer that the movie surpassed.
What abt ENDGAME??
Honestly
Endgame?
I think this trailer is amazing, but endgame's 2nd trailer was insane. the music elevated that one to another level.
Have you even seen The Last Jedi trailer??
 @juliusvogel4834  Last Jedi
NorthernLaw yeah but the force awakens hype was way better.
The comic con/d23 2017 teaser was better and they need to realesse it in hd/4k
I agree
 @hayden2283   what trailer
 @rassingh8185  but a Dumber movie
 @CW-mi1gp  dark knight is crap
Endgame: 
Imma bout to end this man's whole career
Blue Milk Joker
Lion king was close, the 2019 one
It’s only rival is The Revenant
Well
End game trailer: r u sure about that?
TTV.atomic Dont get me wrong, Endgame was a great movie, but the trailer sucked 🙄
Joker teaser
 @werdidas4872  infinity war > endgame
Agreed
Ever heard of the Jurassic park franchise
Raimi Spider-Man trailers were better, Nolan's Batman trailers were better especially Dark Knight and Dark Knight Rises. The Comic Con trailer for Infinity War was better than this one.
Blue Milk ever saw joker ?
TDK is still the best superhero movie ever. Trailer? Not sure.
 @daddy_.rome0  don't call out your mom's name everywhere Steve 😘
Top 8's Ha! Hahahahaha!
 @rassingh8185  😂😂😂funny joke
Endgame
 @gabepark1513  action scenes were trash in tdk
What about end game trailer?That was just EPIC.
 @jordanwebster1728  yeah I hate DC fans for this reason. The think that only DC makes 'mature' movies. When they end up making trash like Aquaman they still like it.
 @KieranCoyne08  okay
 @MooseMaverick.  not that really it was a great trailer but IW was just amazing
 @ethancreegan1843  certainly not
 @Aditya-kx7qo  ok boomer
I will miss endgame and infinity war, also the endgame has the most hyped trailer because of this movie...
 @werdidas4872  trailer was good but the movie sucked
Blue Milk let the final battle begin
Blue Milk endgame
Endgame managed to come near coz the kept it immensely secretive.
Ever heard of Dark knight teaser?
Maybe force awakens and end game till today
Top 8's sounds like u corrupted by your own arrogance and fanboyism
Just cuz u a marvel fanboy who discards dc, doesn’t mean u can not appreciate or recognise the quality of the movie.
You speaking subjectively.
But the objective truth and facts are the dark knight is a great movie, whether you like it or not, or whether you want to admit it
Ever heard of Avengers: Endgame
C W ya it’s dogshit. The dark knight rises is way better.
 @rassingh8185  Dark Knight was extremely overrated.

Endgame ! They didnt even gave the movie name
As well as endgame
 @jarrettwhitlow8700  biased.
I know. Even endgame
 @rassingh8185  yea, because didn't want to spoil anything. But Infinity war the movie is better
 @jarrettwhitlow8700  your opinion is invalidated
For sure
 @subhojitb.433  r/whoooosh
Infinity war is better than endgame while TDK is arguably the most overrated movie of all time, batman begins and logan are better.
 @vie3147  the dark knihjt is better than marvel
 @jordanwebster1728  TDK has higher ratings than dark knihjt
So blooody trueee

IT WILL MAKE INFINITY WAR LOOK LIKE AN MIDGET
Exactly 😍😍😍😍
Are you familiar with Endgame?
 @reneepeck8094  Stop being delusional.
 @Godzilla370  Calling me a marvel tard even though I said batman begins is better lol.
Old Wolf's Legion Look I’m sorry, but TDK is way better than any other Comic book movie. There’s some comic book movies that are on TDK’s level like Spiderverse, Spider-Man 2, and a few others. But the MCU can’t even hold a candle to the Dark Knight. Winter Solider is the closest.
 @reneepeck8094  That's your opinion but mine is that its overrated as hell and heath ledger gets way too much credit only because he died. Imo Aaron Eckhart was better and batman begins was better. Logan,Infinity war, and the joker were better.
Old Wolf's Legion I disagree whole heartedly although I can understand your perspective. I also agree it’s overrated, but I still think it’s a great movie even though it ain’t perfect (I would give it like a 4.5/5.). Even if Heath didn’t die, he still would’ve done an amazing job and still is one of the best acting performances in the comic book genre regardless of his death. I mean he’s still better than almost everyone in the comic book genre when it comes to acting. Aaron Eckhart did get overshadowed unfortunately, but still a great actor as well. I wouldn’t consider Batman Begins better tbh because the Dark Knight improves on everything that Batman Begins did like acting, music, story, writing, villain, characters, etc. I can’t even think of one thing that Batman Begins did better. I dare say that The Dark Knight is the second greatest sequel of all time (First being Blade Runner 2049 imo). I can see how you think Joker and Logan is better, but Infinity War? Infinity War might be good, but it ain’t on Logan’s level.
 @reneepeck8094  Ok
 @hayden2283  no
Endgame
Period.
Ever heard of avengers endgame?
Endgame
Star wars the force awakens
Ever heard of James Cameron Avatar 2? That movie will completly blow up Infinity War and could possibily beat Endgame.
Stormlight Archive. You heard it hear first.
This movie was good but endgame wasn’t. Endgame overrated asf!
Endgame
Yeah it's Called Endgame
 @rassingh8185  I do agree with not the best but it is my favorite. There are many better superhero movies than Endgame. But the third act really did it for me, if it wasn't for the fan service at the end then I would put the movie quite low down my list but the third act really had me. Best theatre experience I've ever had. You could arguably say it's the best fan service ever.
 @jasonnewman1118  No, nothing about it worked. It takes the super out of super hero, and looks dark and brooding to give itself some kind of self described importance. If it were at all well made it would have at least held my attention enough to keep me awake. But you liked Endgame over any other MCu movie so I know what your opinion is worth.
 @jarrettwhitlow8700  thanks for respecting my opinion but now saying that nothing worked was not smart.  Please watch it again and properly understand the movie.
Hayden Chris handsome
Endgame?
Umar Larsh No. I'm pretty sure yours is.
The social network and inception trailers are the best trailers period.
 @jarrettwhitlow8700  The Dark Knight is crap? You're out of your mind you're probably one of those people who doesn't give DC a chance

This movie trailer gave me chills!
I highly doubt it! We were all transfixed as to how the Avengers were going to face Thanos for the first time and how he would be portrayed. And we were not disappointed in the slightest.
 @CW-mi1gp  he is talking about the trailer.
Blue Milk no cap bro
Every heard of Godzilla king of the monsters
I was shaking watching this trailer for the first time, it was madness at school, everyone where talking about at class, even I got detention.i don't think any movie will live up to the hype this movie was released.
Totally agree

The Only Next thing Marvel can do that would be Mega is Have Tobey,Andrew and Tom together for a Spider-Verse Film
What if they make an Onslaught movie with the Avengers, X - men and Fantastic Four?
What if they made a marvel universe vs dc universe movie then? I guess that can live up to the hype

So glad I saw Endgame in theaters
 @vie3147  incase ur being serious and I'm not understanding the joke, tdk stands for the dark night-a trilogy of dark batman movies that are some of the best batman content currently
 @jarrettwhitlow8700  oh look Marvel fanboi got triggered.
 @rx3la  Lol you are just Jealous of TDK's success. If it would have released in 2018 or 19, it would have grossed more money than endgame
 @randomness5281  no lol, dark Knight is crap for you because you didn't understand it😂😂😂
 @elise3455  Endgame is criminally overrated, it has just stupid time travel
Bro, what about The dark Knight ? I think it was better than Infinity War and endgame
 @devankgulati1637  idc about money it just wasn't good
 @devankgulati1637  sure buddy. Keep saying stuff to validate your failure in highschool
 @randomness5281  Blah blah blah
 @devankgulati1637  I'm literally a writer.
 @jarrettwhitlow8700  That doesn't matter, being a writer doesn't mean you are better than others
 @devankgulati1637  You said I was illiterate, not self-absorbed.
lol ye have little
Faith. If it’s one thing is humans do, we find a way to make great things happen. Think about how hype Star Wars was because it was the first of the fantasy/action big cinema kind. You don’t think in 60 years someone could out do avengers like avengers out did the movies before. It’s not like this is with superstardom of music artists like MJ, Queen, etc. where people just aren’t being superstars like that anymore. Cinema is still growing. Have faith my friend. Don’t be so drastic lol
Spiderman: No Way Home could...
 @hayden2283  NO ONE CARES
No way home 😙😛
 @lukamagicgod  still as good as Infinity War?  I dont think so
You didn’t watch the Spider-Man No Way Home trailer, huh?
Nope , You are wrong!!
Spiderman No way home is same 😂
No way home trailer!!!!!!
 @rassingh8185  TDK's trailer is good, but Infinity wars trailer is better. In my opinion.
 @rassingh8185  Wow he is deluded and is a fanboy because he called TDK crap? Wow
 @rassingh8185  Fanboys? You sound like a fanboy here who couldnt handle opinions
 @reneepeck8094  Lol its just an opinion,  movies are subjective stop acting like what ever you say is a fact. Call people a fanboy when you are a fanboy yourself.
 @gamebond6248  Hey man people have different opinions.
 @idkwhattonamethisshti  I mean its an opinion if you like it or not.
 @Godzilla370  Dc fanboy
 @derceral2682  No not really, lol. But your right though about the opinion.
'Captain Marvel' is the Worst Marvel Movie Ever.... 👍🏻...
I've been watching Marvel since childhood
Force awakens
 @rassingh8185 as a movie it’s probably better. But don’t lie to yourself, infinity war had the better trailer by far
never again in the cinema
To be honest I do not think there will ever be a movie or storytelling just like marvel did it lined everything up so perfectly it’s in my opinion the best movie ever made it’s just perfect nothing else to it
Secret wars
Music of this trailer 🔥🔥🔥
Fr
today marks the 5 year anniversary since this trailer dropped.
5 years man. I turned 13 the day this came put, I'm 18 now bro.
Ik right Whatever it takes.....
whatever it takes....................
That includes me! A community.
This was the greatest trailer I ever seen at the time. They truly made it feel like “you waited 10 years for this… hes here” that vibe still gets me hype till this day
I can only hope this legacy continues on for these Infinity War/Endgame trailers.
2023 ☝️
That’s facts tho
Bro always, this was the MCU that we all knew and that it was at their best. I will always remember Infinity War and Endgame in theaters and seeing all the fans reactions, it was just epic!

mainly because phase 4 sucks lmao
Destiny finds a way man.
Loops, in this exact case.
Multiversus saga will probably be very good, with Kang Dynasty and Secret Wars, but...I don't think will have the impact that Infinity War ( and Endgame ) had. Sure, will be many heroes brought together ( again ), some of them may be from old movies, but many of them are kinda new. She hulk, kamala khan, moon knight, eternals, so on. In the past, we had many movies with our loved characters and actors, so we tied a bond with them. Now, many of them ( avengers ) won't return and they need to fill the space with some new guys. No offence for the ones I mentioned like She hulk, kamala khan, moon knight, etc and also no offence for all the fans that love these characters. But...we only had one movie with them, or some short episodes show, and we didn't tied a bond with them and also, let's be real, they ( at least these ones ) aren't as notorious like old avengers. I would also say many of them not as powerful as old avengers, but, don't want to start a polemic. So, that's my point of view. Kang Dynasty and Secret Wars will be great ( needs to be ) but, I don't think will be epic like Infinity saga.
Because those were the great days of MCU that have been missed by many of us fans!
 @LongNguyen-tn6jw  For real. I tapped out after episode 1 of She Hulk. I was super hyped for MCU but man it has been shitting the bed after Endgame.
2023 here and endgame trailer
Fun fact: this was the first avengers movie I saw back then
I come back to watch it here and there to be reminded how good the MCU used to be. The last good MCU movie imo.
 @catalinmihailescu  MCU is dead sadly.
 @RiloTribez  It was a great trailer. Sadly this was the last good MCU movie. I remember when I was younger I didn't entirely know what Phase 1-3 was gonna be mainly because I was quite young and didn't understand but my mom and I would go see every movie. What annoyed me at the time was a lot of the new MCU fans only saw Infinity War and Endgame and claimed they were fans. I was like you guys skipped the whole saga and didn't even knew the MCU existed prior. Good times. Sad to see where the mcu is now.
It's only 5 years old chill
 @denniswarren1933   From 8th grader to legal adult. Its much more significance to 5 years than you think.
This trailer still does put a smile on my face even after 5 years
Hoy 5 años desde que salió esta maravillosa película. Éramos muy felices en esa época
I don't know why this Trailer is still giving me Goosebumps
I don't think anyone could forget those feelings they had at the end of this epic movie. 5 years later and watching Endgame 2000 times and I'm still recovering.
Back when I still went to the cinemas to see a movie. This trailer still gives me goosebumps
“Evacuate the city, engage all defences and get this man a shield.” This scene always gave me chills, but it carries so much more weight tonight!
It's 2023 and it's still a masterpiece! It never goes out of style.
Really Missing the hype and excitement we had during the Infinity Saga. 😢❤
I don’t think any movie can create the emotions I had when watching this and endgame. The build up towards these was insanely good
Best MCU movie ever, still give me chills til today
im glad that i was born in the right generation to be able to witness the mcu.
"There was an idea to bring together a group of remarkable people"..... This line still play in my head till today.
I’ve been pretty much done with the MCU since Endgame, but I still come back to experience this trailer again from time to time.
Absolutely crazy this film is now 5 years old.
One of the best films ever.
Forever, my all time favorite movie trailer. Will forever give me chills. Even the dialogue is like poetry.
I’ll never forget walking out of the theater at the end and a bunch of kids and even adults were full on sobbing. Good times!
No matter how many times we watch this trailer, we will always feel THAT hype.
After 5 years this still gives the same goosebumps as the first time
I was 10 when this film came out, 5 years later, this movie still gives me the chills
I've watched this trailer that many times. It never gets old. This will always be great.
Why u going now??😭😭
Yeah...😔
RIP Chadwick
Paul Cannizzaro he’s gone now :(
The way he says it just makes you feel something more than a movie
Wow . . .man thats real.
I’m watching the movie right now
Stop lying
Rip the black panther
You will always be our King, Chad.
​ @dadame2423  he's not lying tho
top three marvel movie of all time
Yeah, started with the birth of Iron Man and ended with his death (for me).
It has been a privilege.
Let us pledge to let the MCU never die
Yeah but u could’ve seen star wars
 @davidshooks3362  yea but thats only 3 movies vs 20ish
 @JohnSmith-wt5zw  did i ask?
Being born during Star Wars was better. The greatest trilogy of all time. We had never seen anything like it. We’ve seen this before. Totally agree. But Star Wars was something else
WX11 thats the con about marvel. To much movies. They over produce and it makes the movies not as excitinng
Marvel is good but AVATAR is wayyyy more exciting, I really need to watch Avatar 2
Or the skywalker saga or fast and furious or terminator an many more
 @tylerf6082  i wasnt comparing star wars to the mcu
NickTheToxic -_- fast and Furious ran out of ideas long ago
Transformers saga
 @userprprp  when paul died?
 @steverogers1437  am not saying compare this two. Am just saying that they are nice sagas
NickTheToxic -_- it ended with Paul but Hobbs and Shaw was my favorite out out the saga even tho it wasent part of it It was good
 @userprprp  i agree
On god
Me too...
No, I am glad to be in the decade of the James Cameron Avatar Saga, that us truly going to be a masterpiece
Appreciate it
Now imagine you were born in 2030.
Same
 @tylerf6082  I liked star wars back then but I was also 8 when it came out.  I look back now and it's still entertaining but very simple.  I give Lucas credit as it was something never done like that before.  What MCU did putting together all these movies into one conclusion was fantastic and it would be hard pressed to duplicate this again.  I just hope mcu does not follow star wars lead and make the same story over and over.
 @userprprp  Agree
Same
From the start to the end
MCU SUCKS
 @thighguy4534  thanks for the spoiler :(
same
Same
 @hristogeorgiev3203  explain why.
Spider-Man says thy spiderman who almost got kicked out of the mcu
Spider-Man oh yeah, remember your near father, tony? what happened to him? oh wai-
Steve Rogers this generation is messed up! What you on about??
 @jedgarcia8360  let me guess, you were born in the 80s
Steve Rogers I wish haha class of '96 babies
 @tylerf6082  I was watching back than star wars trilogy and than Marvel, Marvel was even bigger event, much bigger than star wars trilogy, Star wars was something else, but Marvel movies were entirely else compared to Star Wars trilogy, just better and mor exciting with more fans.
We have never this from marvel before so yes it's one time the best, sure star wars truly great but Marvel surpassed in every way on every level, sorry but it's true, and that's coming from someone who is star wars fan.
 @odst1778  No it on't, it will be boring to say the least losts of technology and lame story nothing much.
 @Apeironization1  i dont think so, Avatar will probably be the most successful franchise of all time, every single film gaining no less than 2 Billion, every film will have a unique story as Cameron Said, This decade will be truly dominated by Avatar
 @odst1778  Not really I know a lot of people that Avatar was one timne watching and if they keep getting the same lame story with ultra-technology in it, it wouldn't do much, people like good stories not some high-tech miracles.
you litealy spoke for me
Me to
 @11weaponx  22
 @annabethchase917  thanks Annabeth! yes, no other franchise is come close to the MCU.. n thats a good thing.. step your game up, everyone n everything else! 😁😉🖕

 @steverogers1437  rly?
 @coballoon  woah
Steve Rogers ikr
As one who grew up on these comics when they cost 12 cents, I am glad I lived long enough to see credible epic action films like these.
Same I was born a year after the first ever iron man movie came out and I watched the avengers (original) movie in theaters believe it or not
 @odst1778   you mena that movie that makes blue people like hunters and has Zoe in it?
I was born the day the first mcu movie came out so yeah this is my life
I'm glad that I was born in the right generation to grow up with first Marvel's movies and then witness the MCU.
But what if in the distant future there is a another birth: a birth of set of movies that bring joy beyond compare.

A movie better than infinity war...
Yes...thats a fortune
Same
Best MCU trailer ever, change my mind
 @jpmflicks  Avengers Endgame
 @jpmflicks  BEST TRAILEY EVER
 @tylerf6082  I hate star wars!
 @tylerf6082  thats why they're the movie franchise that has made the most money right 🙄
Same
I’m glad that I was born at the right time for the algorithm show me this again.
I was born before the mcu
Was was 3 when it started
Yet I watched iron man when I was 3
My childhood IS the MCU
 @tylerf6082  bruh you literally saw star trek
 @thighguy4534  started with fighting a bald guy and ended with fighting a bald guy
Not the best generation
Omg this is the worst time in movie history
same
Wow that is americas a$$
 @odst1778  🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
 @odst1778  You must be really looking forward to Avatar 2,3,4 and 5 starring the unforgettable Sam Whatshisface.... 👍
Fun tuber bc idk lol
 @thighguy4534  me too
Henry Eden were talking about the mcu right now, not rappers
Henry Eden read the comment again, do you see the word "rapper" anywhere? See it isn't there, but you know what is there "MCU"
Ha me too
I just finished all the movies and shows last week!
 @thighguy4534  haha..for me and a lot of people... I'm with MCU till the end of the line
Yup!
Yes
I agree
 @thighguy4534  hasn’t ended guy
 @davidshooks3362  hell to the no
HELL YEAH ABSOLUTELY
 @Apeironization1  lord of the rings movies were better
Marvel movies are trash you havent watched many movies if you say marvel is the best
Sure there are some good marvel movies but most of them are overrated
Everyone said iron mans death was emotional but it wasnt
SAME
Yeah It Started From Birth Of Ghost Rider To Spiderman No Way Home (for me)
Steve Rogers
Me too like lord what if I wa born in 2040 or sum
 @odst1778  Dude, what the heck are you talking about. Avatar is a movie that managed to make the highest grossing ticket sale of the history of cinema, and yet be so freaking forgettable that almost nobody can quote a single phrase from it.
Yeah men
 @thighguy4534  same
Some

Am i only who clearly see hulk in the trailer even though he didnt transform
 @captainhorizon4059  oh yes that for some reason was never real tony and Steve never meet in avengers infinity war
 @tylerf6082  lol
Same
I basically grew up with the MCU
Yeah, Start From X Men To Thor 4 😍
 @nickolask0580  Yeah, even for me, the F&F saga ended when Paul died. He was the best part about that franchise even though Vin was at the lead.
 @thighguy4534  nah, it started with Spider-Man 2002
Same.
 @odst1778  record your reaction this year
He @steve Roger u were the in the battle don't u remember  BTW how  is Peggy
The hype for this and Endgame can't be explained with words. New generations wont understand.
Imagine start of mcu by watching iron man at 10 years old without knowing what the hell is this about
 @thighguy4534  bro u spoiled is Ironman really dead please reply so I know ur alive
 @userprprp  people seriously still watch this franchise?
 @Egg-sb7wn  to be honest there kinda better movies than infinity war even most old movies from 40-70’s are better than infinity war
Honestly for me it was the sam rami movies that were my childhood
This experience is a once in a lifetime. I am glad I was able enjoy that spectacular momee.
I don't know what you are talking about, I was born yesterday

'Captain Marvel' is the Worst Marvel Movie Ever.... 👍🏻👍🏻
 @trendingnews6679  bro black widow
 @thighguy4534  cry
This was the best era of Marvel Of course, Marvel continues, but maybe it won't be able to create hype like this movie and end game. I am glad that I was a part of this commotion with the people.
 @aayushmukherjee4198  aged like milk.
I watched them, originals are good, sequels are trash, and personally i am more prequel fan, watched clone wars too, star wars is a nice franchise I think (maybe mostly originals) but I think it's nowhere near marvel, at least for me. I mean, nobody's near Marvel. There is nothing that comes close to it as franchise and movie universe. Lord of rings, they are good, but they are not as popular, Harry Potter is great, but it didn't conquered whole world in level of MCU. Fast and Furious is good too cuz it made many movies and is commercial success, but it didn't get too popular in level of Marvel. Transformers are a lot of commercial success but didn't conquered fans and become popular in level of fans. DC movies getting better but not close to Marvel and certainly don't influence culture much. Star Wars in last times became more of, niche or a bit smaller, I mean in terms of its influence and power on culture. You get the point. They are good, but they aren't close to MCU. MCU managed to conquer lots of people and most human population, and became a cultural phenomenon

This will I think be viewed as the high point of the MCU starting with iron man and ending with endgame. The MCU golden age
Have been waiting the whole year for this mcu. Trust me I’m curious then you’re
And now the opposite
 @11weaponx  6 original films. 1 brilliant animated show.

Yeah!
I've still tears in my eyes while I am watching the trailer 🥹
I've been watching Marvel since childhood
When thanos died the MCU died

it's been 5 years but still gives me goosebumps.
It's Been 5 Years, Still Gives Me Goosebumps Like Watching It For The First Time. Life Was So Good Back In Those Days 🔥.
5 years and still give me goosebumps
5 years later and we’ll never get back the feeling of watching a movie this good for the first time
Man I'll never forget the feeling watching this trailer for the first time, especially when the theme song plays slowly and you hear that deep voice. straight chills...
Nothing will ever be the same after this masterpiece. Chills even after 5 years
Nunca voy a olvidar cuándo repetía el tráiler una y otra vez, esta fue mi etapa final como fan, después de ellos no hay algo que se les compare.
Can’t believe it’s been 4 years already. The movies still a masterpiece.
It's 5 years, and still you can feel those vibrations🖤🖤🖤
One of the things I love about IW is that practically no one was done dirty, and everyone got their chance to shine. That goes for Starlord too because being emotional is perfectly in character for him, and it was HIS almost successful plan that he messed up.
I can't believe its been 5 years, nothing can describe the hype I felt for this film, it was the pinnacle of the MCU
Hype is still up and goes day by day everytime I watch this trailer it's give goosebumps 😍
Rewatching this trailer again and I'm still getting goosebumps
You know that a trailer is good when it still gives you goosebumps even after almost 4 years
Cant believe it’s been almost 5 years since Infinity War came out. I still remember the day I saw it in theaters it was wild. 😢
5 years now! The hype for Avengers Infinity War was incredible, I remember getting excited each time a new trailer came out, watching the movie opening weekend was an  unforgettable experience , good times 👏👏👏👏
The absolute hype for this movie was incredible. It feels so weird how far back this was. Obviously Endgame was the culmination of everything and was amazing, but this movie was more iconic to me.
This is one of the greatest movie trailers of all time and it STILL gives me chills.
If you come back to this trailer just to go back to that feeling you had the first time you saw it, you are a legend!
“Evacuate the city, engage all defenses, and get this man a shield.“
From now on, this line will never be the same... Chadwick Boseman, gone too soon. RIP.
Leom so funny

I know this is said a lot but, this feels like it was just a year ago 😢

 @haydenfinley664  how so?
 @pcpt  nobody in their right mind would say black panther is better than infinity war bro
 @RA-tp4pr  also you completely ignored the fact you used representation is why people like it. as if representation is a bad thing.
 @pcpt  if youre just going to be here to insult people and a movie without any reasoning you may as well click off this video and annoy other people
Lol I just watched infinity and end game along all the mcu movies last week for the first time
Always coming back to watch
Jesus loves you
Nostalg...
Yep bro
 @anoniem-wb9ok  it felt like it released 2months agooo for me still why this is so nostalgiccc I want to go back in that time
Endgame sucked

Infinity war is superior
 @Onepieceistheworstfuckinganime  Nah, I really do love the movie. And if your just gonna go around saying this stuff then just don’t comment.
 @cringekiller348  yep sheeeesh
This movie makes Justice league fill like a Netflix show
 @TOXICYT2016  No one is talking about that and justice league is way better than this garbage because it makes sense.
This was the most watched trailler. I dunno if it still is.
Fax this movie is nearly perfect
 @thewolverine8414  Nearly perfect? Kid this movie almost made no sense whatsoever so what do you mean almost perfect?

 @hulk6805  and i can tell that you are a kid based on ur talking and ur name
 @hulk6805  AND THIS COMMENT IS ABOUT THE TRAILER NOT THE FUKING GREEN BLOB
 @NPC5273  
Hulk brought half universe life back
You are kid lol 😆
 @hulk6805  and tony saved the whole universe, no need the green blob, and why am i a kid? Could you explain?
And it also good if you keep sing even if you dont watch the trailer
Yup
 @hulk6805  then go read comics, no need to spil the fun here my man.
Actuallly...😨
Definitely I often re-watch this trailer I just love it!
 @NPC5273  do you know one thing? That thumbnail me hulk aakhir aaya kaha se
 @NPC5273  nothing, i was just asking that is thumbnail correct or wrong? Coz i dont think its correct coz there is hulk present there but in movie hulk was not there after starting
Yesssss
5* years
 @hulk6805  "You're a kid, lol!" said the kid who typed "you are kid lol😆"

Snap Thanos
How is this quote relevant to our or his life?
 @onyxtomahawk4788  It's a memorable qoute
rip chadwick baseman died by cancer in age 43 r.i.p Chadwick Boseman ??? - 2020
how about "Up general, this is no place to die"
Underrated comment
Thanos didnt snap away is cancer
This line has no relevance to his life lol if anything, your quote should have been “in my culture, death is not the end. It’s more of a stepping-off point. You reach out with both hands, and Bast and Sekhmet, they lead you into the green veld where you can run forever”
I really hate the way those words are pronounced
 @Langkowski  Chadwick himself tried to bring a more natural African-American accent for the T'Challa character. Because that is the character's origin.
😣😣😣😣😣😣😣
Stop fishing for likes. He died. Move on.

Still gives me the goosebumps!😳❤️🔥💥💯
my. god. Its been 5 years and I still get chills when I watch this trailer.
The soundtrack, the voices, this movie.... OMG!!!!!
Although I'm depressed that it is all over, I just can't believe It that such great movies is now ended
I love how they did justice to every single character in this movie.
This feels soooo nostalgic to me and just feels great, this is like one of my favorite trailers
5 years later...still feel the same 😍❤
This is not just movie, it's an emotion.
5 year and still give me GOOSEBUMPS
It's been five years.. and still gives me  goosebumps 😭❤️🔥
It was such a masterpiece ..that I'm watching the trailer after 5 years.
Even I get the same hype for this movie better than endgame....Love you Avengers..
Still getting chills😢
Just watched this trailer again for the epic speech given by Thanos. Love it. I get more hype watching this trailer and more feels than anything that has come after endgame.
I'm honestly gonna miss the hype around Infinity War and Endgame. Feels like an experience like this won't happen again.
No matter how much time passes, no matter how many times I have seen the movie, no matter how mediocre the latest installments of the MCU are, this trailer still seems epic to me.
It’s been 5 years and I still got goosebumps
I still come back and STILL GET GOOSEBUMPS
Aún no puedo superar Infinity war el tráiler 2018 fue el mejor triste como termino pero ame la película porque si lo hacen
I always come back to this to get the feelings of the good old days
Rewatching a trailer after 4 years isn't something one considers when balancing their day, but this...does put a smile on my face.
Still i can feel that goosebumps ❤
Привет с 2023 года, пересматриваю и всё ещё сердце щемит, охх и было же время эпичное когда весь мир ждал этот фильм 🔥❤️‍🔥🔥
Okay
True
That emotion is pain.
It was an experience. One emotion isnt enough to describe this movie.
Same pinch kgf 2
And this emotion is almost 4 Years Old... I don't even know how it happened. How did we get so old
No it’s just a movie
You said a mouthfull
UwU this is sooooo deep


Jk 
I feel u bro
it is a movie lmfao
It's a permanent memory
It's a permanent memory
 @saumyarathod8643  it's an emotion, this dialogue was created by KGF movie fans but everyone else is using it.
Yup
Greatest trailer ever made by far
Right 👍😌
Fax
Ya
Armando Solorio not in our lifetime, no.  But we got to experience it when it released - in the theater, no less!
Yeah. It was a once in a lifetime cinematic event.  What an amazing and exciting experience it was.
Its 2020, and I should be asleep getting ready for work tomorrow morning. But I randomly watching MCU movie scenes. I see the Infinity War trailer and click play. Still a better trailer and movie than endgame. Still get goosebumps....
I wish I had gotten to see it in the theaters :(
Wait until the x-men arrive in the mcu!
yeah
I do believe it is possible again... the only way to outdo this is if Marvel brings in the X-men with the Avengers. 💯
Ad8tyan it'll be phase 5 or even 6 before this happens again  bruv
Three Treasures fr
Dr doom maybe?
It can happen with the X-men, Fantastic Four or Justice League (yeah, I pretend the DCEU does not exist because it’s a disrespect, I just hope one day there could be an awesome JL movie like the animated Crisis on two Earths or something like that) Also it could happen with Spider-Man!!
Spiderverse, X men and hypothetically fantastic four finna change this
Oh trust me it will.
Not unless DC gets its act together
But if time travel could be created then we can go back just like in Endgame.
Spider-Verse(? XD
If DC can get their act together then maybe there will be an experience like this again.
 @niklas5675  and the Fantastic 4. It will be the most global movie in the world. Better than Endgame
 @dudeofsteel3118  and Fantastic 4
ymeu I'll be hype again
Wait for Secret wars..
we still have more mcu movies like Hawkeye, black widow, doctor strange 2, thor love and thunder, black panther 2, spiderman miles Morales.
 @niklas5675  x-men is not going to reach avengers in any time close, so will the hype.
Where did that bring you?




Back to me 🔥
If the spiderverse movie really happen, there will be a similar hype
Same
i think it would happen again with Spider man 3
The Avengers saga will never be forgotten.
Fr
Right???
The hype alone is enough to crush any man's mind. I don't think there will ever be something as epic as this but we can dream
It will happen again....Future Movies will have this exact feel if not, then a feel that will surpass this!
The spider verse have very hipe
SAME
Not the best movies, but the BEST CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE I've been through
 @niklas5675  eh
If the DCEU was done correctly and not rush (The death of Superman for example), we would have had a 2nd coming to that same hype if not bigger.
X Men and Fantastic Four could have similar hype. but idk what after
 @star-ks3bs  dang you really missed out
Spiderman spiderverse
The Avengers run was unprecedented, something we’d never seen before which added to the excitement and hype. Not to mention they casted so great for the most part Lee by RDJ. No matter what due to it this run being the first of its kind we will never get to experience this again at this level
I just wish they did Hulk any sort of Justice in these films. 2008 savage Hulk is still the best for me
I’m sure it will once Sonic becomes a franchise... hopefully...
 @star-ks3bs  there gonna be tokenized and bad
 @dankyz8323  yeah but it’s ok! i can enjoy it on disney plus :)
ikr
 @star-ks3bs  it’s not the same, when I watched it the audience with me were cheering and it was awesome. Watching it on Disney plus doesn’t give u the same experience
 @dankyz8323  yeah i know! :(
i didn’t say it would be the same experience but i meant that i can still enjoy it.  Besides, if i watched it when it came out i would’ve been really confused because i hadn’t seen much of the other movies. watching it on disney i was able to watch the others and then enjoy endgame
So true.
Marvel phases 4-6 will likely end with a few climactic films, similar to this
 @gelatinoustyrant3789  omg i hope so!!!
Rumors are the next thanos after get next ten years of movies will be galactas. Although I’m not sure I’ll like it due to it being an entire new set of characters.
 @Nikhil-lr9wy  omggg yeah i hope!!
the best movie experiences i had
It will with the Avatar sequels. That's if they're any good and the franchise still has the fanbase it once did.
Avengers Battlworlds will also be another one.
...there is the Snyder cut of Justice league... no? Okay...
Live action Spiderverse with tobey and andrew.
I hope they can create the same kind of hype for other movies too but since stan lee is not anymore it does seem dificult
After finishing Endgame, I legit felt empty. Because there wasn't really anything else as exciting to look forward to.
Me too !
 @dudeofsteel3118  Imagine if we had a HUGE crossover event that mixed x-men, avengers and fantastic 4... It would be legend!
 @onderokay3805  Yeah, it would!  Who knows when they'll decide to make that movie though. They would have to set the storyline up so that both universes mixing together makes sense, and knowing Marvel that would be over a couple movies.
If Spider-Man 3 is a spider verse film like it’s rumoured to be then the hype levels could potentially match this
Well you’re definitely wrong about that
What abut secret wars and secret invasion
Justice league?
yeah and i remember some grungy people complaining in comments - they just didnt understand the significance or just wanted to be different from others - fake people
It will happen again. Wait till secret wars
It will happen to other shows but there will never be a franchise or other show that sticks the ending the way infinity war does
 @badge8233  
I hope the MCU is brave enough to do Secret Wars.
 @rogueagent0191  Like the hype around star wars when it came out! Amazing we got to experience something so huge
I think it will happen after 10 years
One of the most ambitious movie moments in history. 

Bro the moment tickets were available, the website just crashed. The hype was incredible.
No other movie could get a light year close to how amazing these movies are (unless it's from marvel ofc ofc)
Maybe the next BIG avengers movie will be even bigger than Infinity War&Endgame who knows
 @westsideamasra  we just dont kno what to expect after everything that happened in endgame :C
 @westsideamasra  it would be tough match the hype without cap, stark etc
 @legendaryalex8720  i mean yeah youre probably right but i dont want MCU to go all downhill after all this time
Maybe secret wars will happen again
 @Doctor..Manhattan  3 of the main avengers are gone and spiderman is with Sony or smthn I doubt they gonna make avengers 5 anytime soon
I think galactus can be something like this but you are right
Spiderman 3 has that hype
Just be glad you where apart of such a colossal event
so true!
If Doctor Doom ends up being the next mcu big bad and he’s done right we might be in for a surprise :)
 @star-ks3bs  same :(
Right bro
It will bro trust me it might take a few years in the mcu but I'm hyped for them setting up all the new characters like that fantastic four, kang the conqueror and galactus going to be mad. Thanks is just the beginning
Exactly I was so fkin hyped so glad covid wasn’t around back then otherwize it would all be for nothin
 @imsubbbingtoeveryonewhosub8578  right correct
The trailer was misleading like hell! I don't want to get into the specifics. But if you don't know what I'm talking about then you never will. I'm talking trailer now.
Man... The whole world was hyped for infinity war and endgame😃😃😃
 @mishukhroy6013  Yes, they were. Even me. But when I saw it, that was the turning point. They were a good film for action but that's as far as I can say about it. It's like watching the original Lion King and then watch the new live action one. Once you know something, it feels different when you see something else.
 @jpotent1019  yeah... Exactly...but anyways... I still remember those hyped feelings of mine... Most of the time I was thinking about what's gonna happen... Those days were good😁🤘
It won't......but that's good.......that means we won't expect something to match that and just be disappointed. Let infinity war and endgame be what it is.
 @threetreasures7698  lol ye have little
Faith. If it’s one thing is humans do, we find a way to make great things happen. Think about how hype Star Wars was because it was the first of the fantasy/action big cinema kind. You don’t think in 60 years someone could out do avengers like avengers out did the movies before. It’s not like this is with superstardom of music artists like MJ, Queen, etc. where people just aren’t being superstars like that anymore. Cinema is still growing. Have faith my friend. Don’t be so drastic lol
Wait for 2029 😂
Idk maybe if they make dc Batman who laughs movie but that’ll be kinda weird
Dude the new avengers will come out sometime this decade
Just wait for Secret Wars, there are so many amazing moments  and characters teaming up during the event that will create massive hype, the biggest moment being when Doctor Doom becomes God Doom and then every hero / villain teaming up to fight him, even thanos
Two future potential events that could match: Avengers vs. X-Men, and Marvel vs. DC. Hope to see them both in the next 20 years.
same
Spider-Man Far From Home: 👁👄👁
 @layan5752  the spider-man far from home movie wasn’t as hyped as endgame and infinity war lmao
Its literally happening again with no way home
 @bibblesoak4900  im talking abt views bcuz getting nearly 50 million views in a day, its still getting hyped but i agree definitely not as much as endgame and infinity war
Spider-Man will do it
 @bibblesoak4900  uh yea it is
Spiderman No Way Home says hi :)
No way home says hi
It did a month ago. Any body wanna guess why?
yeah
Hello Peter
Spider-man: no way home is currently kind of reminding me of that hype because people think that Tobey and Andrew's spider man will be in the movie too
That's what they said after Star Wars 2 times and now Marvel so you never know 🤷‍♂️
Marvel be like, just wait for Spider-man No Way Home.
If X- Men is done right and comic book movie fatigue has not set in entirely then it can top the hype of Avengers finale. 

X- Men deals with themes that more people can relate to on a personal level. If done right, much like the 90s, X-Men and Spiderman can carry Marvel by themselves, just like Batman has been doing for DC for decades.

It was the films that made Avengers relevant again. Most of these characters were lingering in the forgotten zone before 2008 Iron Man spawned an idea that ended up working.
Definitely
Spider-Man No Way Home is coming so it’s happening again!
Kind of did for Spiderman NWH
Well, you're wrong!!!!!!!!
no way home
Then spiderman no way home came along
bahaha and then No Way Home happened
Spider man no way home said hold my beer
You should stop saying that, because your always wrong
No way home be like :- You haven't seen anything Armando 😂😂
Same with spiderman no way home because seeing no way home was the best experience i had ever had in an insane long time
No way home was the closest I got to reliving the hype.
 @niklas5675  meh
 @niklas5675  after seeing dark pheonix.. I don't have even the closest of medium hopes
secret wars may ve
 @niklas5675  💤
Spider-Man no way home would like to speak with you
ayy no way home tho!
maybe in avatar 2
Avatar 2 man. It’s here. It’s official. It gave me the biggest goosebumps in my life
 @mihneapopa8856  frrr it best be good
secret wars soon
it will happened if secret wars adapt to live action in the future
'Captain Marvel' is the Worst Marvel Movie Ever.... 👍🏻. 👍🏻.
The hype peaked.
I still believe there will be another huge event in the future!! Kang, Doom, Galactus etc just wait!! Trust in Marvel!!
Just wait until the new 2 Avengers drop.
 @starset4life175  I'm from the future and Secret Wars is gonna happen
 @chosenone3527  
I’m aware
Secret wars would probably change this
Spiderman NWH
When the next marvel characters are set up and the next avenger movie will be hype if they do it right.
They just announced to brand new avengers movies
Avengers secret wars : allow me to introduce myself
KANG DYNASTY AND SECRET WARS BABY
It is goung to happen in kang dy asty and sectet wars
I've been watching Marvel since childhood
My brother Marvel's watch has ended.
Kang Dynasty and Secret Wars
yow
Agreed
Some people move on, but not us.
Thanos said that right when I saw this comment lol
For me the soundtrack hits the hardest
Thanos would be proud of this comment lol
Nice 😍😍
1000th like btw
i love how they really changed thanos, in this trailer he is almost a sadistic vilan, but then in the movie we get a way better version
True
Well said..
Yeeeeeeeeeeees
Wait a min hulk is not there in infinity click blit
Yessir
😂😂😂
No hulk scamed
It feels like the trailer been out for 3 months the hype was insane you know when people do those mad rumour vids and they get tons of views that’s when you know theirs HYPR this is my top 5 movies
True 😌
Heck no man! This trailer was totally misleading. If anything it should put a frown on your face. If you don't know what I'm talking about then by now, especially after 3 years, then you never will. Still hasn't got it yet. Talk about late.
Yep
This trailer almost feels like a short film in it's own right.
 @Kango234  lol
Same here
lol cmon
Bad joke
I expect that guy to make wAtCh kGf 2 comment
We tell people to move on.. some do… but not us.
As all things should be
True
hahaha
Nah rewatching it after 4 years
You watching KGF CHAPTER 2 TRAILER
The hype leading up to this movie will never be topped. 22 films all lead up to the best Marvel movie ever. I will never forget watching it for the first time.
Still giving me goosebumps
This movie had it all:

1. The best comic villain reveal that took a 10 year build-up.

2. The best hero entrance scene with Thor's Stormbreaker.

3. A culmination of our original Avengers actually losing for once instead of them winning each time.

4. Shattering records in almost every sense.

5. Last but not the least - showcasing what one single movie (Iron Man 2008) could help catapult an entire Universe if done right.
Who else wishes to go back in time and experience it again for the 1st time?
It's Been 10 year And Still it gives goosebumps
Still Goosebumps for me😍
Awesome trailer 👌in MCU
This never fails me to drop me into nostalgia when mcu was at peak
Tears to my eyes. The MCU at the peak of its powers was something to behold. I miss these days. It’s unfortunate and rather strange how quickly they lost the magic after the infinity saga. I remember after endgame saying “I know there’s so many more stories to tell, but I would not be mad if they ended the MCU right here.” How little did I know at the time that I wish that’s what WOULD have happened. I’m writing this fresh off the conclusion of secret invasion and man it’s sad to see what the MCU has become. Still amazing to reminisce.
Finally seeing thanos go completely unhinged against everyone in this was totally epic. After years and years of teasing him, the avengers finally met their match. Seeing this movie in the theater the first time was such a surreal experience with everyone else in there. If you didnt, you definitely missed out.
Is anyone else so grateful this and Endgame came out before Covid could stop us seeing it in Cinemas? It would've been absolute agony if these movies were delayed
I wish we get another Marvel movie like this one. Infinity War is awesome. It’s a shame that the MCU is dead and we are getting terrible movies now. I will never forgive Disney for what they did to Marvel and the MCU.
The hype was real and you can still feel it. The best
I am still watching this, and getting the same goosebumps 🔥🔥🔥
I’ve been rewatching all of the MCU recently, and I have yet to revisit Infinity War by the time of me writing this. Seeing this trailer again is truly a special moment, this is telling you that everything these heroes have been throughout an entire decade is nothing compared to the true final boss of this entire saga. The stakes are even higher than they have ever been, everybody is going to play their part in this massive event, the action is going to go all out even harder than it ever had, and the villain will be NOTHING like anyone else before him. This was THE movie that all of its predecessors have been building up to all these years. Truly one of the most epic moments in all of cinema, preserved in this time capsule of a trailer.

EDIT: Just got back from rewatching Infinity War, and man, it is so much better than I remembered. Both it, and Endgame, felt like deserving payoffs to the entire MCU, and I never felt more satisfied by these movies.
It's still giving me chills, like this is my first time seeing the trailer.

Edit
Rest In Paradise, Chadwick Boseman. Thank you for entertaining us with the Black Panther. 
"WAKANDA FOREVER!"
-Black Panther
Still give me goosebumps 😌
This film exceeded even the highest expectations that will never be forgotten. Try to do better, I know, you can't, because this is a MASTERPIECE, now and forever. Marvel for life👊
This movie is really a once-in-a-lifetime experience, no matter how many years pass this movie will still be talked about for many generations to come.
Every now I then I gotta come back and pay my respect to one of the greatest movies ever. The I'll never forget the hype.
5 years later and Thanos entry still giving goosebumps
Everybody's wish is that
Yes
Am i the only one who thinks that covid will end one day and things will be normal?
 @blackfox658  may be covid will snap his finger just like thanos did to vanish  50 % of humans
All
Meeeeee
Me especially considering I didn’t watch marvel until summer 2020
I want to relive this and relive endgame for the first time
oh yeah! the first time I saw I was just running around showing it to everybody who weren't even marvel fans
yes
😭😭😭 bro i watched whole mcu movies 20 times but i never experienced 1st 😭😭😭
Me
Me because I never got to I got into marvel after this :(
I dooo always!!!!
Everyone I guess. But honestly I would be happy if I could just watch it on the big screen once more, with a lot of other people
never saw it
mee
Its gonna be my first timeeee
The ending broke me for a year.
I watched Infinity War and Endgame for the first time yesterday.
 @jlkomina778  I wish I had seen at the movies but unfortunately, I wasn't into the MCU three years ago. However, I'm so glad there was just a bathroom break between Infinity War and Endgame for me instead of AN ENTIRE YEAR.
The time was so good back then
watch it in a vr theatre and you'll relive that moment but only with a heavy headset on
I wish I could experience it literally for the first time 😭. There was a ton of hype around this movie, and I begin how stupid I was for not letting all the hype hype for Infinity War. And I’m currently living to regret that decision 😭😭
I’ve never seen any of them. Can’t wait
I wish i could go back and see it in the theater for the first time. I was unlucky and watched it only after the DVD was released.
Me and i shed tears
 @randomchimp3999  I had the ending of endgame spoiled for me so I didn't enjoy it as much as I would have.
Yes
uou ta perfeito demais
My girlfriend is about to get that chance tonight!
 @sadadokis4796  yes , when croud bursted up when cap lift mjolinir
55 years ago, lol.
How this commant 55 years old
We really need to find that fkn time stone bruh
 @blackfox658  i wish too
Replicating seeing this in cinemas with a room full of marvel fans would be the greatest feat in history
Everybody bro literally everybody 😭❤️
First time I saw it, I cried because it was so beautiful.  Never again we shall witness such beauty.  I never thought I would say that I was happy the villain won but that's the beauty of it.  Now we got to see when the power of good is put to the test.
I wish I could wake up without any memories of marvel so that I could re discover it and fall in love once more
Wait how is this comment from 55 years ago😂
That would've been torture waiting for Endgame. So grateful.
I agree
This is why I’m very excited to go back to theaters when it’s finally safe to do so. This and Endgame were not just movies, they were events.
I can't wait for the next big theater movie once this whole thing is over. I don't know what it's gonna be, but I'm ready for whatever it is. I just want to be hyped with a 100 people again lol
 @woahwoah2207  I'm most excited for Dune if we can ever see it in a theater
Just thought that when I came and rewatched this lol
 @elsassypineapple  it’s safe. You’ll be fine. Come to the theatre. Take a breath. Relax and enjoy the show
overhyped.
 @philithegamer8265  No !
I also thought about this that It would be horrible
 @philithegamer8265  No !
Thank God it released before Covid
Oh yeas...that would've been torture
For real when I was in cinema we were all shouting and brought a lot of hype
Fr
 @woahwoah2207 The next big movie event will be Avengers:Secret Wars
Also grateful not dying in absolute agony from Covid.
yeah, corona kinda came at the perfect time for the mcu
The world would've went to war because of the delay.
would've ruined the hype
Not really they can just put it on disney plus
Am i the only one who thinks that covid will end one day and things will be normal? Is it only me?
 @its.fireball  dude am i the only one who thinks that covid will end one day and things will be normal for real? Pls i want someone to agree with me
 @blackfox658  looks like it will be soon but who knows
 @blackfox658   you're not alone on that one
*internally screaming*
Yeah
It wouldn’t be the same if it would release in Disney+
THANK GOD
 @woahwoah2207  Although Fantastic Beasts 2 was a trainwreck I'm hoping the third one is going to be that movie you're describing.
 @blackfox658  Things will go back to normal eventually for sure. We can't stay like this indefinitely it's just not good for anyone. We are not meant to live this way.
 @tytytherussianspy2778  never seen these movies. I hope that you will enjoy the next one!
 @woahwoah2207  lol they are the prequels to Harry Potter
Yes omg it would be terrible torture
Thank god iron man came out in 2008 or else we wouldn’t have got a 10th anniversary that’s why this movie happened
The True Fans are still here 2 Years later.
I know right ? That's why I love MCU so much
Brings me back to the night I saw Infinity War in theaters
im still here for the trailer 😭
Marvel is really good
Has that effect! 👌🏽
I know bro win I saw this trailer it was like posted 1hr ago it almost had a million views
This is our legacy.....Future Generations will not understand the hype and emotional feelings attached with this Movie Saga
Whenever I am seeing it's like it's my first time l' m seeing and the feeling that can true fan can hear or feel it l love it
Yes true
Quite possibly the best MCU trailer there has been
Same i am a hardcore iron man fan since age of ultron but when iron man died i cried all day
 @Xxx_Deadshot_xxX  o yes but I think he will back on MCU so we don't worry  .l' m just waiting for her new solo film 👍🤘
It is the perfect trailer.
Omg hello Elon I never knew you liked the avengers
Lol same, brother.
I watch all the time 😂😂
The trailer is fake you know.
I thought it was just me.  Like this trailer happened during better times
Are those chills multiplying? Asking for a friend
I agree
same
 @ramilaboo3630  huh??
For some reason I watch this trailer everyday it makes my day
 @samscansam790  Clearly you're a true fan
True fans
Yeah bro me too
You are joking
Stg
The part where Ironman gets floored by thanos is what got me. Had me thinking he would die in the first part lol.
Man i remember this day 2017 😭 it was my 13th birthday when this trailer dropped
Rata Gurney man, i was 4 watching Iron Man 😔 memories were made
Same
Goosebumps
Me too
BTW I like your name XD
Same bro
Your name puts a smile on my face
Ye, this trailer is iconic
I want to go back and experience the movie again in the theater ❤️
Yes
TheFallen M true
Yeah dawg
I have a movie and yet it's
The trailer is AMAZING!! 
I remember the excitement seeing it the first time.
Right
Best MCU trailer ever
 @kershybar6950   like me
Watch “Alita Battle Angel” You won't regret it.
Same here ❤
TheFallen M i read your comment as soon as he said that😂😂😂
This is better than endgame
(Calmly smiles)
Crazy how this was 2 years ago
Ur name though🤣
I liked this comment just because of the name and profile pic lol
Rip Black Panther
no. mejusto
RIP Chadwick. You will always be Our Ling. Love you.
 @kershybar6950  I'm still here after 5 years later.
 @ElonMasks  so am I🫡🫡
🙏
I know right! The hype was real. Never forget…
“THERE WAS AN IDEA” “To bring together……a group of remarkable people” - this with the soft piano notes and then into the horns of the comic showing the hero’s is simply iconic.
The hype was strong with this film!
Watching this trailer for the first time was not great,it was PHENOMENAL!
Still get goosebumps no matter how many times I've watched it
I watched this in the theater with my big sister. We’re in our 20s, but we are close and we always see the “big” movies that release in theaters. We were both blown away & I remember us being so upset about being left on a cliffhanger. We saw Endgame together as well and I cried at the end. Thank you Marvel for everything.
This is one of the very few films whose trailer is as good as the film itself.❤
2023 and still such a great trailer. So many fans wanted Thanos to finally show up and he left the crowds in theaters in silence.  IMHO That was the best ending of any MCU movie so far.
Even after 3 years it still gives me chills!
still gives me the chills
This is where MCU peaked. It will take ten more years to reach anywhere near this level. What an absolutely beautiful time it was!
Still get goosebumps from this trailer 5 years later
New generation will never understand how hyped we all have been for this
its been 6 years and i can feel goosebumps still
Some of the greatest goosebumps ive ever felt
5 years later, and still the best movie of all time
"Fun isn't something one considers when balancing the universe, but this does put a smile on my face." 🙏🏼❤
This trailer is the best one I have ever seen and the movie surpassed the expectations I had 🔥
Goosebumps whenever you watch it
The hype for this was literally nothing short of unthinkable. Unbelievable.
I remember first watching this trailer five years ago and getting goosebumps I still get them now.
The chills. There was no level of hype greater then infinity I’ve seen in my lifetime.
man this infinity war in 2018 but stills gots some favorite to watch again till tomorrow 😂
We didn't deserve this movie. We honestly didn't. The hype for this was unreal
Me too bro
Same
Its gonna be 4 years next week
Agreed
Same
Word!!
This is one of the greatest film trailers of all time hands down
Same
Me too😭😭
*almost 4*
俺も
Yeah ikr
That voice that Josh Brolin dose that to people.
4
Make it 30 and it will still be the same feeling
Yep...2 years later this movie remains marvels masterpiece. And this trailer is still the best trailer ever produced imo. Everything is perfect.
Inevitable
 @ISetYourFaceOnFire  comic con trailer beats this!
I wish they released that trailer tho
 @ISetYourFaceOnFire  the dark knight rises trailer 3 beats this to brutal death! go c that first then make such a stupid claim!
Tbh I think this movie is decent but there are so many plot holes that make me think this movie is idiotic

Endgame however, is a masterpiece in my opinion

(Edit: after rewatching Endgame it’s just an 8/10 movie, it’s not a masterpiece)
 @macewindu4165  which plot holes?
 @Ps3rikbr68  well there were so many ways that they could have beaten Thanos, like why did Strange not make a time loop? Why did he not use the time stone? Why did he not sling ring cut Thanos? Why did they not just kill him when he was in a trance? Why did they not sling ring cut him (yes I’m saying this again because it was the easiest way they could have just beated him)

And out of all the ways Thanos could have solved overpopulation, like making more liveable planets, making planets bigger, making more liveable areas on planets, giving the universe more education, making more farming methods, making more easier types of foods to make... he chose to kill half of the universe?

I don’t know there were so many ways Thanos and the Avengers could have won
 @macewindu4165  Thanos says "Universe requires correction" he knows nowadays humans and animals are so selfish
 @macewindu4165  I totally agree with you
The future will NEVER know what the hype for this movie was
Final Attack on titan season hype is also BIG.
 @abhiv7279  It may. Just like The people who knew the hype after empire strikes back. There may be another franchise which gets a big hype like this one.
 @vincentsmith7428  amen brother that one will be epic
Remember when people were mad at Thanos’ design
 @macewindu4165  well there were so many ways that they could have beaten Thanos, like why did Strange not make a time loop? Why did he not use the time stone? Why did he not sling ring cut Thanos? Why did they not just kill him when he was in a trance? Why did they not sling ring cut him (yes I’m saying this again because it was the easiest way they could have just beated him)

I don’t know there were so many ways Thanos and the Avengers could have won
master windu. The sling ring was explained as Thanos's skin is incredibly durable. Strange didn't make a time loop because thanos wasn't beyond time like dormammu, with each death of strange, thanos will also not remember what happened as time reverses. Dormammu wasn't affected by this, but thanos would've been and then thanos wouldn't be annoyed by it. 
Also, he was called mad titan for a reason. You could ask similar questions of why did the villain not do this for many other excellent villains. The answer is he is a villain, he sees things in a specific way like we all do
E
The hype foe endgame was even more
 @prateeksingh8815  hell no baby
 @macewindu4165  nah endgame is a good movie but the first 2 hours before the final battle are boring this movie plot holes are just unexplained scene like if dr strange would never give up the stone how the hell thanos gets the stone
It was wild
 @harelhoshea7042  yeah have to agree with you now

Both movies are heavily overrated imo
 @macewindu4165  for your first plot hole it can be explained that somehow Thanos will find a way to win and even if he doesn’t it’s possible that maybe some other person could ruin the universe

For your second concern, Thanos is the MAD titan, he’s messed up, if I remember there was a scene that involved the living tribunal which decided Thanos was guilty and Thanos still went on
 @macewindu4165  Cause Doctor Strange had already seen these versions of future there were around a million outcomes and he saw the win in only 1 this means that he had already seen the consequence of creating time loop and all that stuff I think u need to watch the movie again lol.
 @dee4498  bruh that scene doesn’t change anything lmao. That scene is literally the “shut the hell up” scene since Marvel knew that fans would point out all the ways Thanos could have been defeated so they just made that scene to obviously and easily cover things up

It doesn’t change anything you should watch infinity war pitch meeting
 @macewindu4165  y
 @dee4498  h
 @macewindu4165  Even if it was a cover up thing still they made us get an answer of your question so its the studios fault not the whole movie's.
If you think that then you clearly haven’t lived through the hype for Frozen 2. I am so so sorry that you will never ever know what it feels like to experience the incredible hype for that film.
I miss the hype, man, i really do :(
 @abhiv7279   only the people who watched both the trailer and themovie
 @macewindu4165  time loop woudlnt worm cause you Cant use the stones against the stones. Thanos said it in endgame. Russos said thanos is too durable for sling ring trick. Gimme some more plot holes to solve.
 @macewindu4165  Lmao all the things you listed are so easily explainable its crazy
 @goopboop7746  uh oh marvel fanboy can’t except movie flaws 🙄
I miss the good old days ❤️
 @macewindu4165  
Important disclaimer: do not wish to spark a big internet battle with you, I simply thought it would fun to go through your points and explain my side. Please do not take this comment too seriously.

Dr Strange’s time loop only stopped Dormammu because it got annoyed and left. It would be weird and out-of-character in my opinion if Thanos just got bored and stopped his plan because of the time loop, as Thanos was established up to that point in the movie as someone extremely devoted to his plans. And since Thanos wouldn’t stop, Strange could have just continued it forever, but that isn’t really saving half the universe as much as it is imprisoning the WHOLE universe in an inescapable repeating loop (I would have tried to use more words than loop but I can’t really think of any synonyms for it off the top of my head lol).

As for the time stone, could you provide a more specific moment you think it should’ve been used? I feel like it wouldn’t have really helped during the Ebony Maw fight, he couldn’t use it on the ship as if he tried doing the motions with his hands Maw’s spikes would’ve impaled him, he does use it to determine the different futures leading up tot the confrontation with Thanos, and then when Thanos does arrive Strange doesn’t even have the stone because he’s hiding it in place of a fake. I might be forgetting something but I can’t remember a moment in the movie where he doesn’t already use the time stone that it would have changed anything.

As for the sling rings, Thanos has the space stone and can teleport anywhere, coupled with his extremely durable skin.

I do agree with your final question about them not just stabbing Thanos while in his trance or something like that, however just like the points before this I feel the movie is  not really made any worse by having a few plotholes in it, because none of these things really create big unexplained flaws in the movie or affect the viewing experience, and I don’t think they’re really worth bringing up as they aren’t even really something you would think of unless you actively tried to poke holes in the movie’s logic. 

As for Thanos having a bunch of different ways to solve his plan, I agree that his plan is dumb. But I don’t think that’s a problem with the movie, because he is the villain and you’re supposed to disagree with him. Thanos is shown in Infinity War and Endgame to be a character who, as wise as he thinks he is, is still at his core an egotistical sociopath, and as a result it makes sense that his plan, which on surface level seems noble, is really insane under the lens of a normal person not warped by Thanos’ twisted ideas.

Anyway, those are just my thoughts. Feel free to respond, but again, please don’t try to start a big fight over it, because all I was trying to accomplish with this comment was a fun look at the movie and a discussion with someone about it. Thanks!
 @trogbison1625  huh well my perspective has changed

For the time stone I was just thinking why couldn’t strange use it on Thanos to make him a kid or something? We see it can rewind time to make objects and life forms what they ONCE were so couldn’t he make Thanos a baby?

If strange used his most powerful weapon things could be different

Also if Thanos used the reality stone to you know, alter reality he would have won instantly as well

Other than that and a few of the plot holes you also mentioned yeah there aren’t to many so I guess I was wrong
 @macewindu4165  
Huh, I see. I do agree the Time and Reality Stones would’ve ended things much quicker, so I guess I see your point.
Star Wars the force awakens same hype
ive never seen a marvel movie in my life but even i felt something when thanos snapped at the end..
The hype for you was real in Rise of Iron. You are nothing now. Please stay in D1.
 @macewindu4165  infinity war was way better than endgame tf lol. Last 30 minutes of endgame was good that's it, Russo brothers dropped the ball hard af.
"God is real.
God loves you.
God wants the best for you.
Believe that.
I do."

Chris Pratt
This movie lived up to the hype, probably the master piece of the MCU, best trailers aswell
 @vincentsmith7428  season 4 part 2 will break every record of hype I believe
nwh
 @dee4498  no dude, just because they made a "scene" like that does not at all cover it up, for the very least we need an actual explanation, not such a lazy cover up to shut the audience up. His criticism is still valid
2:00; where does the hulk came from...?
You watching KGF CHAPTER 2 TRAILER
And it lived up to every bit of it, which is even crazier
'Captain Marvel' is the Worst Marvel Movie Ever.... 👍🏻.. 👍🏻
still waiting for this iconic scene 2:00
I say it not just as a Marvel fan but a movie fan, too..this is the greatest trailer of all time.
Re watching this legendary trailer after 5 years ...still feels pumped up
The Infinity Saga will always be one of cinema's greatest achievements to me.
I come back and watch this trailer a couple times a yr. I’ll never forget the hype of opening day theatre was electric. Just had to be there
"Fun isn't something one considers when balancing the universe. But this... does put a smile on my face." 1:38 

This line and this trailer gives me goosebumps every time I hear it
Greatest moment in cinema history!!!
The day i will never forget.. What a masterpiece.
Seeing this trailer for the first time was a once in a lifetime feeling
A moment of silence for the future generations who didn't get to experience this one in a lifetime hype and theater experience
Many years later and still the best movie
I can watch this movie 100 times and still not get bored
It's 2023 and this still gives me chills😊
Endgame and infinity wars are some of the best marvel movies, and maybe even some of the best movies ever.
still have the same goosebumps on Avengers theme ❤
I dont think the future generations will understand the depth of the hype and excitement we felt waiting for this masterpiece
Watching it after 5 years and got my eyes watered. what a legacy has been created by marvel. God i love these characters so much. I still remember watching the trailer at least 20-30 times when it was released.
THE HYPE FOR THIS FILM WAS SOMETHING ELSE♥️
The only two marvel films I remember watching are Infinity War and Endgame. It sure was an experience, would have loved to have the context of all before seeing them. It felt amazing.
The movie and the Trailer is sooo good that people still come to see after 5 years
All 20 something movies definitely agree
Except captain marvel that was crap and almost pointless
 @dontmatter4423  Yea we don’t talk about that shitty snoozefest, LOL, I remember watching it after about 15-20 Minutes, Got bored to death and I fell asleep (Actually fell asleep lol) Woke up at the post credits scene
Ok
Is is the greatest it’s so hard to put together so many characters in so many movies and keeping a story still feeling fresh and also having one of the greatest villains in cinema history aswell
 @dontmatter4423  Indeed it's not that good but I'mma just appreciate it since it's also not "the worst" for me. Every franchise has that least favorite movie anyway.
Except that Hulk movie with Edward Norton
 @dontmatter4423  Talk about incredible hulk
The dark world
 @MaverickAdriel  and eternals
 @dontmatter4423  not completely true, Captain marvel tells the story of Agent of shield Furry, Monica Rambea
Did the line ever make the Final Cut?
 @jorgebiez  no I don't think so
 @jorgebiez Thanos said something similar and along those lines in Endgame, but I think this one is better.
If they had added " I am inevitable " with the same dialogue, it will be 🤯🤯
 @jellyjam1120  agreed.
 @jellyjam1120  You can’t deny it was still a true achievement to have something like a cinematic universe pay off in a Great film.
And that is me. How ironic
The hype. Everyone in my school was talking about it. I went to see it on opening day with my friend. I cried on the way home ;-;
 @PrimeTime_Pictures  Same
A great time to be alive
Ya
SO TRUE PEOPLE WERE LOSING THEIR MINDS ABOUT THE HYPE AND GUESS WHAT? THE MOVIE WAS INCREDIBLE
sniff i missed seeing endgame and infinity war in the theater 😭
No worries, if I get to be parent of that future generation I will show them :)
Watched it when it released on the first day
There will be another day another movie
still holding out hope that avengers vs xmen happens and its as hype as iw and eg
F
 @andrewwong2399  avengers vs Justice League vs Watchmen
I can’timagine it
i feel bad for those people
Literally I had gone for the first show of this movie in my country and the hype was surreal
They will get something like this in the future
 @marvelanddcfan5029  ew pick a side dude
Me 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🤞
 @PrimeTime_Pictures  our theater was silent walking out.  It was like everyone was leaving a funeral.
Agreed
If you grew up with these movies you are apart of the master race… MCU>Star Wars
NWH was even better
 @thanosfarmer8304  in my opinion NWH was great, but it didnt had great action, nail biting scenes, dialogues like infinity war.
And a moment of silence for us that we never gonna experience Avengers part 50 in theatres with ultra high technology or maybe in 10D 11D😂😂😂😂
Amen to that 👏🇺🇸🔥
Boomers tell me how epic Star wars 4 was in theaters all I said was... Yea we have infinity war "infin what..." 😏
I would have loved to see the Matrix, terminator, and LOTR in theaters for the pure hipe like this
I did but I feel bad for people who didn’t too
A moment of silence for the past generation who didn't get to experience the hype & theatrical experience of movies like spiderman nwh.....& doctor stange mom
Agree
And that is me 😥😥
What a hype it was😌
I would sell my soul to see infinty war and endgame in theaters becouse I never got the chance to
Yes
'Captain Marvel' is the Worst Marvel Movie Ever.... 👍🏻👍🏻...
Agree
Glad that I experienced infinity war , endgame and no way home
Agreed
True
When I have kids i’m making them watch these movies in order and show them the trailers to make them get hyped
They’ll get to experience it for secret wars
Don't worry their home setups will be far better than than the theaters in our time😐
This was literally the only thing I focused on that entire dreaded and long year
Yeah this is what I imagine how ppl felt when The Empire Strikes Back came out
That moment when Thor enters in Wakanda.... that is the one of the best moment of my life 😌❤️
I remember looking forward to this years in advance
Same Rules Apply yes, hbu ?
True.m.
Maybe they will with secret wars but this and no way home are top tier hype
I doubt they will, the hype...the hype train that lasted around 10 years
 @theuniversalviewer6334  and after it, Endgame was my focus. I grew up seeing the first avengers movie in theaters when I was 8. Infinity War was by far the best MCU film.
The only thing else that matches the hype is Endgame, No Way Home and The Force Awakens (and maybe the The Last Jedi)
 @gg-kr8ws  yep. Past gen's had Star Wars, E.T, T2, Batman, JP, Spider-Man, Pirates of the Caribbean, Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and others. Today we have Fast and Furious, MCU and Disney movies.
Truth
Years and months of anticipation lead up to one of the most epic opening nights I’ve ever seen or heard of….period
Agree
Black Panther, Infinity War, Endgame and No Way Home hype was real! Everyone I knew were talking about it for months and they were the only movies everyone was looking forward too. I could still remember when everyone used to say Wakanda Forever and do the sign for months after they saw the Black Panther trailer. Good times
 @le_meme_man8983   The Force Awakens, Rogue One, the Last Jedi, and the Mandalorian created a lot of hype where I’m from
 @projectx7453  I know. But Disney Star Wars prime hype was 2015-2016, now it really isn't big
Exactly
Fr😂😂😂
Yes! So grateful to be a part of it all!!!
 @theuniversalviewer6334  4yrs for me
 @desmonides  not even close
Watch Infinity war on the 27 and endgame on the 26 

… So I got to see endgame before infinity war turned two. 😊
In 2018 i was 9 that time and that time it becomes me a nostalgia and after endgame can't feel that
💯💯💯💯💯
Ft
We all felt that way about Star Wars back in the late 70's
This and GOT
I was 8 when I watched infinity war, it and Ragnarok got me into the MCU. One of the best decisions of my life
 @sujalchoudhury9915  If that is truly one of your best moments in life.. I hope you realize that's tragic af.
This Generation doesnt even understand the depth of the Hype as i haven't watched it
Fr, no way home couldn't even touch this hype
It’s weird to think that our kids won’t understand the hype for this movie and Endgame. They’ll have their own I’m sure, but they won’t know what it was like for these movies.
This will forever be my favorite marvel movie.
La mejor pelicula de superheroes que he visto ❤
5 years later I still get hyped everythime I watch this trailer... one of the best movies ever
The nostalgia is ripping my body atom by atom and theres nothing i can do to stop it
Came back 5 years later, still got goosebumps.
It’s tradition to come back to this trailer every once in a while
Being able to see this in theaters was a beautiful 1 time experience
I remember when I first watched this trailer in like December of 2017. I can’t believe it’s been almost 6 years, time flies.
This movie made the history... Honestly I don't think I'll ever be more hyped than I was in 2018 for this movie
5 years later, I still remember the time I watched this with my family:( Good old days of MCU
This movie is 5 years old but still feels like it’s new
"Dread it. Run from it. Destiny still arrives." 

This line is universal now.
Doesn´t matter what marvel is now...we should honor this movie for eternity
2023 and this still gives me goosebumps
Its not just a movie its emotion after 5 years i still cry at the end
It's been 5 years and I'm still excited and screaming like a little boy. Plus how wild is it that we were rushing to watch this in theatres and now we can watch on our phones like its nothing?
IMO this movie is the best MCU project simply because it's not about the heroes. This is a Thanos movie. It's so different to everything that came before or after it. A true classic
It’s hard to believe that this was 3 years ago. Time sure does fly by.
The music, omg, 5 years later and I've still got goosebumps 😩🔥🔥🔥🔥
im so mad i got spoiled for both endgame and war
That’s literally what every generation will say lmao
 @neo7588  same man !
Christina Zhang Or Star Wars the Phantom Menace. Lucky for them that generation also got The Return of the King hype as well.
2 wheek ago comment
Like people in the early 80s had for the Star Wars.
Im 12
Loki Laufeyson nope I’ll talk as much as I like and there’s literally nothing you can do about it
oh they will, trust me they will have movies greater than this
yeah.
Justin Gary But why do you people do on it random videos, I see other religious people do it as well, can't you do it on a religious video, you not exactly attracting a religious audience on videos like this
Dude I remember watching an nba game then this trailer came. Then I ended up showing my Mom the trailer and begged to watch it until we did and man. WAKANDA FOREVER
forget our kids!
I'm already planning on creating the same experience for my kids. Showing them the marvel movies in chronological order, slowly... To build things up
 @alessandricedric1995  Just don't show them thor the dark world it's so dull and boring
Actually our kids infinity war/endgame will be secret wars
For real bro
 @savageraccoon787   I am a not english I am malayali nice to meet you😍
Yes because this group of avengers is original
Yea
Bruh not even the hype for spiderman 3 was dis good
 @samisikdar5417  yeah but the next generation big hype event would be like a tik tok collab movie 😂
 @neo7588  i got kind of spoiled on endgame one of my friends that saw it told me that iron man "retired" at the end
 @themanthemyth2106  i was playing an online game and someone joined a lobby and his name was "Iron man dies"
 @neo7588  lol
Thor entrance into Wakanda with Groot on side and Rocket on his shoulder will always be #1 screen depiction.
That's interesting how that feeling works. You've been a fan of something for years and have been following it from the very beginning.  Then suddenly all these younger people start liking it too and even though they're a fan, the same as you, you still can't help but feel like they're taking something you really appreciate for granted.
 @samisikdar5417  facts lol
Spider-Man…
 @neo7588  my brother got spoiler through a video game. Some horrible dude came through blasting spoilers and left
Yes
I also thought that
 @neo7588  iron man dies
 @dollarstorethriftshop99  jk XD
Fr fr, back when I was in high school I remember that the other kids would literally watch and rewatch this trailer constantly, that’s how hyped they were.
 @alessandricedric1995  you just stole my words man 
But show them trailer first then after a month show them the movie to create the same hype as we did
 @rogue9230  nothing can be as same as infinity saga bro
 @popireal3628  killing man the 2nd most killing scene in the history of superhero movies after endgame portal scene
 @donaustin4189  Disney did say secret wars will be bigger than endgame if you read the comics you know they're not lying
Just like how our parents had star wars
Don’t worry, the hype is better with nwh
I m literly crying and im goose bumped now thanks
Right❤️
I wonder if marvel will be around when we have Kids I would watch this as an adult
i doubt that. we still get the hype of star wars, so they will get the hype of marvel movies too
its a generation thing; every generation had movies that only people from those generations can relate that specfic hype but i feel like infinity war was THAT movie in which all superheroes from one universe came together and fought against a common enemy so it was a whole new concept that i don't think was ever created before.
They won't have to wait for 1 yr! For thr buildup the doubts and all
 @marvynluna4994  yeah exactly and the pain of the characters disappearing and us not knowing whether they would come back or nott
I was born in the middle of Harry potter saga.
I didn't have the same hype as those who came before me, but I did like it
Imagine star wars for our kids
Yeah fax
'Captain Marvel' is the Worst Marvel Movie Ever.... 👍🏻. 👍🏻👍🏻.
I was 13 years old when I saw this in theaters. I would say, even Endgame and No Way Home, sure it was best, but NOTHING can beat this comic book movie that was already become PERFECT in its own. Forever be my number 1 movie in the world.
Yeah
Nope
yes it is... just to remember how awesome this was
Indeed
True
2:00 
What the hell hulk is doing there?
 @invalidsm  then y did you come back?
I miss it
Just watched the entire movie again last night…amazing every time!
Yeah
Yes, for these trailer communities.
This is my first time seeing it. Goosebumps. I'm glad I didn't. But yeah. With hindsight, they were gonna die
 @bambooboi7133  At the time it was to hide spoilers lool
Yeah
Ong
Indeed it is
Indeed
Makes me sad when black panther comes up
i still don't get it. the first vid here thanos didnt have any stones and thor had both eyes but after this and thor had come out then, this trailer also changed but still kept the date and number of views intact.
It’s tradition to never leave
Exactly broooo
It will give you goosebumps even if you have watched the movie a hundred times
I just got chills rewatching this 😂💯
Yeah
Just watched it again, they never should have made Endgame.
🤝 I do this every days
preach it sis
indeed
Literally
Men of culture 🫂
Yes sir
such a good fckn trailer, really gets you hype
So true
yes
Yes it is!!!
Yeah Right, Disappointed with Thor Love and Thunder. Here to remind myself about diamond marvel given in the past
​ @bambooboi7133   He was edited in to trick us
Even more after seeing the piece of trash "Thor: Love and Thunder" was. :(
 @almbg9555  He's a troll. Or a dc fan. Or both
 @juanacarbajal8564  😐😐😐😐 it was sooooooo not trash. That movie (as every other movie in phase four), had a theme and meaning. This phase is about “reaction”. The traumas of endgame has left everyone in these situations. And I find these stories In this phase very unique and something to think about. And Thor 4 was good for many reasons and only had a couple of simple flaws
 @oddysseyholidays8585  M'kay 👍🏻
 @sheikhalinerd8469  for real
 @SpeedRunner606  yeah this trailer is my favorite
Your so very right - kilo wren
Gives me chills every time
I miss these good times 😭
Yea but in the film he says “Destiny arrives all the same…..and now it’s here….or should I say…I AM” they just have used a different take in the trailer
The moment Thanos shows up from the portal in this trailer, with the music is absolute boss!
Indeed
It is inevitable
 @creeperlightning555  Just like agent Smith from the Matrix.
Iconic!
Josh Brolin the most underrated actor in this franchise ever
More like corona still arrives
Yes
For infinity
IMO the best superhero movie and one of the best films of all time.
The stakes, the juggling of the different characters, the fight scenes and of course the GOAT marvel villain thanos
I know right!
My best cinema experience
 @ghosthawk1057  I saw Empire Strikes back as a kid in theatres. I saw Batman. Goonies. Every Marvel film. Avatar. Aliens. And Howard the Duck and yeah this was by far the best cinematic experience of my life.
almost 4 years ago
Ikr
Yeah
More like, the world stopped because of corrupt politicians who use disasters as a way to control people. People are simply forgetting themselves.
It's actually 4
Gabe Holmes Fax
 @RumCaptain  dude not the time or place
Yes   in time you will beleive what is feels to see the time flies by
This is my first theater experience. I don't feel the need to watch movie at theater but this got me. Glad I did
 @user_name_taken_9188  Bruh almost 3.
 @dee4498 Nah it’s 3.
 @jacobplourde2388  No it's 
four. 21 minus 17 is 4
 @jacobplourde2388  Dude😂 this was released in December 2017 that means it is already 3 years old it will be 4 now 😂
To clear things up it’s 3 years and around 5 months so not 4 years but 3 years and 5 months (everyone who said 3 is correct)
 @FirstNameLastName-fu8ml  in time you will know what it feels to watch movie at theater
💯
Why do you have to remind us :(
Endgame was 2 years ago...
2021 and still the most iconic movie ever
it seems like a thousand years ago
So fkn sad
It's hard to believe that this comment was made 3 weeks ago. Time sure does fly by. `
Fr!
In Canon it was 6 years ago
 @nicocrestmere9688  SAME AND WAS ENDGAME!
 @nicocrestmere9688  I was in a karate class back then and he invited every time I argued which was better dc vs marvel I always said marvel and he said marvel was trash, he watched this movie and came back a marvel fan
 @estrone8189  right on man. We bicker and argue which is better but we're all on team comic book movies. Friendly rivalry is best rivalry.
 @nicocrestmere9688  I like all of the movies you listed, and Empire Strikes Back is my favorite Star Wars movie, but I envy you the most for seeing Aliens (and I'm guessing Predator as well) in theaters.
I know right.
I know
It was inevitable
Oof now its 3 months away from 4 yrs
Crazy how much has happened since this came out
Yep it feels like 5 months ago when it was 3 years ago
Yes it does
Now 4 by the end of this november 😭😭
I know bro it's soooooooo good
"And get this man a shield" always have goosebumps
Without a doubt the best trailer I’ve ever seen in my life.
The MCU has past its prime but it doesn’t stop us from cherishing the great old times
For me this is the best MCU movie. First time the hero's actually lost and it was felt even by people who don't like these kind of movies. Amazing film
Considering the fact that this movie is 4 years past, this trailer and the hype building up to it's release is still something that gives me chills. There were some AMAZING Collab movies before Infinity War but this one really took the cake. I'll never get tired of this trailer or the movie. This was something unique. A generational gift. Something that may not happen again for another 40-50 years. I hope I am still alive to see something that could rival the epic that was The Infinity Saga. Cheers to the legends who are still enjoying this trailer!
the greatest movie and the greatest trailer in cinema history❤
6 years later this trailer still giving goosebumps
sad but true: i just got emotional seeing this trailer, reminded me of how powerful the MCU was back then. im literally in tears, no movie trailer has ever felt so real 😭❤️
After all this time... still the greatest trailer/movie marvel ever made
I remember watching this for the first time this is so nostalgic 🔥
The fact that they were able to get everyone to narrate this trailer was DOPE af… thanos talking still gives me chills
5 years now still giving goosebumps 😬
5 years later and it’s still a banger
this still gives me the chills
5 years have passed, and the goosebumps are even more.
The whole movie gives me goosebumps
I am here in 2022.
After 4 years, it still gives me chills.
it’s been 5 years since this legendary trailer dropped…once in a while still think about think, so impactful
I just finished rewatching it. Still the best MCU film ever.
There will never be a better marvel film than this , on my list for top 3 super hero films of all time
Spiderman nwh is the next one
 @kingbadass1135  Can't argue with that one. NWH was epic.
Maybe is there some type of x men crossover.  Who know
The Kang Dynasty and Secret Wars?
 @joshuaallen6268  yep there will be
 @joshuaallen6268  My worry is... Will it be as organically epic like the Infinity Saga movies? Only time will tell.
 @drumhog89  same dude
I hope it is
Nwh like aHeM
 @drumhog89  oh hell yes mate Kevin Feige and Marvel Studios will not disappoint us! The next Event such as infinity War and Engame is called Avengers:Kang Dynasty and Avengers: Secret Wars, we’re currently in the “Multiverse Saga” of shows and films leading up the main ensemble of the Avengers and I must say with the story line Marvel is going with right now we are in a for a treat
 @drumhog89  you know man i leke the new stuff,  and i was really hyped for nwh and it was a great movie, but still, infinity war is in my eyes the original hype movie, those were the heroes i grew up with, nothing will ever make me feel tthe way endgame did. Dont get me wrong i like all the new characters but still, the ogs own my heart
"Everything in my teens and 20s is way more epic than anything that ever was or will be"

Return of the King, Revenge of the Sith, Avatar. Every generation wants to act like their 'big thing' was just the most iconic thing ever. It's just the next flavor of the week, that's all.
 @dtkdave6501  Too bad everything since Endgame except for No Way Home has been terrible at worst and passable at best. Infinity Saga took 11 years to complete and now they want to do a "Multiverse Saga" in like 6...with almost as many movies and too many TV shows to count.

No way will it work the same way. People will not care nearly as much about Marvel once 2025 gets here.
 @creategreatness8823  Well, as time goes on, acting, writing and special effects get better and have more money behind it. They took superheroes that have existed for decades on comic pages and most movies weren't that great or epic and none ever really tied into one another. And if they did, it was easy to forget. Marvel owned the box office from Iron Man 1 until Endgame. And it's not even close. The box office records are there for a reason. It was some of the most captivating cinema to ever hit the screen. 

Long story short, it wasn't just the flavor of the week.
 @drumhog89  It literally was. In the grand scheme of 120+ years of cinema, being the hot thing for 10-15 years isn't all that big of a deal. Just like Westerns used to dominate, superhero movies had their time.

Also, it wasn't until The Avengers that Marvel started "owning the Box Office' Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Thor and Captain America...none of those were the biggest hits of the year they came out. They were blown away by stuff like The Dark Knight, Inception, Transformers, etc

The Avengers put them on top. 2014 Transformers again won. 2015 Star Wars won, and Furious 7 and Jurassic World also beat Age of Ultron. 

They didn't dominate nearly as much as the fans like to imply, and you just said yourself 'the box office is there for a reason' implying that any films that made more than Marvel films are somehow better(which isn't true)

I know every generation thinks their thing is the pinnacle. "New is always better"

But in terms of actual ticket sales and actual pop culture impact, the MCU is big but it is not some Earth-shattering benchmark that some like to make it out to be.

Star Wars, Titanic, and Avatar sold far far more tickets than any Marvel movie. Lord of the Rings beat out most of them in ticket sales and the 3rd film won a record amount of Oscars...it isn't all about Box Office.

The MCU is being watered down with every new crappy movie. In 10-20 years it will only be talked about in terms of starting out really good and then getting really bad.
Fax 💯💯💯💯 frealllz
 @kingbadass1135  nah it was epic but not as epic as Infinity War. Nwh was just making the mcu exciting again but Civil War did the same thing but still wasn't as exciting as Infinity War. The only possible opponents to Infinity War is maybe Avengers: The Kang Dynasty but I'm thinking more Avengers: Secret Wars will do that but only if Tom's Spider-Man gets the venom symbiote and we get bully Holland lol
 @drumhog89  lol the lord of the rings beats this but it was still pretty good
 @creategreatness8823   exactly , I saw lord of the rings return of the king in theaters when I was 10 years old in 2003 and it was one of the best experience ever. Nothing beats that even today.
It's the year 2086 and people are still liking your comment. :)
Avatar
They just spliced together lines from previous films.
 @mox9076  nah he's talking about the start of the trailer when the five OG avengers narrate the avengers protocol speech Nick Fury gave
 @rafaysyed520  Not exactly the OG Avengers, it's actually Sam Jackson, RDJ, Paul Bettany, Hemsworth and Scarlett who are narrating that part.
It's a shame they used a different version of Thanos' speech here in the final cut, as this was already perfect. And the "Fun isn't something one considers when balancing the universe" line is absent altogether.
Thanos talking gives you chills? Wait for Dr. Victor Von Doom to come in Marvel.
 @sumantjaiswal6719  phase four has been a joke. Doctor Doom is going to get done dirty again
U said dope are u selling dope our dies that have some kinda da other meaning I'm serious  please respond !!  Dope  ?????
True
Fun tuber will never know, why they showed hulk in the trailer and not in the movie, 
but he was there for few minutes in the beginning of the film
Fun tuber I know, it would be little more fun if they have shown hulk in wakanda too, he could smash  every bad guys.
Fun tuber okkk
Same here
Guys a quick question so I'm new to the mcu thing I've been watching all movies of mcu in a series tl understand everything and I'm finally gonna watch civil war tommorow i just had a question that in which movies do we get to understand Thanos like what are the movies that i should watch to get a back history of thanks and you know of those other creatures that fox ..mentis that green face women. And batista?
 @bnzbrowman  hey, I am not a expert in explaining stories but I can help you since I have been a marvel fan more than a year so, basically the creatures you are talking about are known as guardian of the galaxy. It has two parts. And the green colour women you are talking about, her name is gamora and she is a daughter of thanos (adopted).
Basically thanos wanted to wipe out or destroy half the population of planets to keep it balance. (There is not a specific movie on in, but it may be in the comic or something).
So basically he destroyed almost all half population of  the planets 
You must know infinity stones right the only stone he had was mind stone before destroying earth.
He adopted another girl named nebula ( gamora step sister) but he didn't love nebula as he loved gamora. Nebula tired her level best to impress thanos in every ways ( you may see in guardian of the galaxy) but thanos never appreciate it. Where as in other hand gamora hated thanos alot, she just didn't like to be with him and never called him dad or even accepted him.
And the other creatures you are talking about are the part of guardian of the galaxy. 
Drax ( Dave butista) he had a wife and a daughter who were killed by Ronan ( guardian of the galaxy villain) so he hated gamora alot at that time.

Peter quil ( starlord) was a normal person who was abducted when he was a child, and then started to steal stuffs.

Rocket (raccoon/fox) I don't know much about him
And groot ( basically a tree)

Mantis( don't know much about it either) but she used to work for a person called ego( peterquil father)

I hope your doubt are clear watch guardian of the galaxy both parts
And enjoy civil war it's us really good
Wanna know much about thanos then check it on YouTube there are couple video based in his backstory.

Feel free to ask any doubt.
Fun tuber thank you.
for real
same
Indeed
Same
same <3
 @Fulcrum1313  omg, I didn't expected you would reply my comment.
It's nice seeing you after long time.
 @aabiahwaqas4589  :)
 @aabiahwaqas4589  This is the way ;D
Yah its same to me
Fun tuber to trick everyone going into the theater
Same here mate
Same
Right here with you bro!
 @aabiahwaqas4589  peter quill was not just a "normal person".. his father is a celestial... So he owns a power of that kind....but he has a human body, so he couldn't grow that much strength ( and also because of his weak willpower)
Ong
Fun tuber it was so people didnt knew that it was gonna be 2 different battlefields and that bruce is gonna be using hulkbuster 2. would have been a huge spoiler for the movie
 @bboi8320  me to bro
I feel a punch in the chest every time I look back, and remember that no other movie experience will ever be as good as this.
Can't believe this was half a decade ago!
Best Mcu movie and one of the best movies all of time. 
I wish I could watch it for the first time again.
Josh Brolin as Thanos was the best decision Marvel has every made in casting. The presence his voice gives the character is ridiculous!
Üstünden çok zaman geçti ama bunu görünce ve o müziği duyunca hâlâ tüylerim diken diken oluyor
This still gives me goosebumps!
Зашел посмотреть трейлер. Целых пять лет прошло. Сколько всего случилось в жизнях и произошло за эти времена. Но насколько остается великое впечатление от фильма и трейлера, что и сейчас трейлер захватывает! Невероятное чувство
It's 2023 and I still come back to watch this masterpiece. No other trailer makes me feel like this one does
5 years later, still coming back to watch this beauty.
Just rewatched this movie last night, so peak. And this trailer was even better I remember seeing it for the first time. Best movie era ever
Marvel Fans coming back to watch this trailer be like:

"Some people move on.... but not us... not us"
wish I could relive the night I saw this for the first time
El mejor trailer que he visto en mi vida
5 years after and still AWESOME.
5 years and this trailer still hits
Definitivamente el mejor trailer de la historia y la mejor película de Marvel studios ❤
Still feels exciting 😍 this is something called world class❤
It's been 5 years and this and endgame still hits hard. That's legendary.
5 years later and I come back here every now and then just because this trailer is legendary
I can't believe that this trailer is now 3 years old. The amount of excitement this brought to our generation is incredible.
Came back 5 years later, still got goosebumps.
10 years from now and Infinity war is still the greatest marvel movie
Hes great but tbh I think the best choice out of everyone was RDJ as Tony but they're all great✌
Marvel always get their cast spot on
Charlie Cox as Daredevil.
 @luigimanks1707  Vincent D'Onofrio as Kingpin too
 @luigimanks1707  J.K Simons as J Jonah Jameson
 @thebeloved3057  not WB since they be replacing ppl left in right has batman and superman and joker
i think RDJ was the best decision for iron man/tony stark
 @ChrisEvans.  Thanos kills iron man in avengers 4
 @bullymaguire8302  lol bully maguire
Rdj,all the chris'es,Chadwick boseman,tom hiddleston,literally all the other cast
Dude made me but the actual hand for Thanos. He goated!
 @TOXICYT2016  i think the current cast for the characters could do a wonderful job if they're given a decent script
ben afflack both looks and sounds like batman and bruce wayne. henry cavil is a bigger superman fan than wb themselves. and as for jared leto, the snyder cut gave us the character we wanted, proving that he can be the joker everyone wants to see
they do good casting, just not writing
I still technically don't get Paul Rudd as Scott Lang, but it somehow works.
He wants to wear that red bandana again
Agreed
RDJ iron man enters the chat
Charlie Cox as Daredevil was the best choice. He does fight scenes while acting blind.
Ryan Reynolds as Captain America

I've been watching Marvel since childhood
no movie or saga will ever compare to this. watching this trailer for the 100th time still feels like watching it for the first time. the things i’d do to go back and do it all again...💔
Dudeeee I didn't even notice 3 years? That's crazy
BDE-Clan endgame wasn’t that hyped compared to infinity war.because infitiy war was the first of its kind.massive crossovers.but in endgame hype was dumbed down
It still gives me chills bro. And a smile on my face
BDE-Clan it was exciting but infinity war brought something nobody ever seen before
The most epic era to live
Don't compare iw and endgame.. Both are equally good in its own way...  The hype for both of them was incredible!! .. And easily the best cinematic event in my life... 💯
 @kylie1026  the dceu will top endgame some year.
 @TMZV-xe9es  LOLOLOLOLOL aquaman made more than the iron man trilogy and most of the first movies. stop pls
 @TMZV-xe9es  and you think most of the movies could too ww?? CAPTAIN MARVEL? pls youre weird
gringoesblanco no no @Al Shahriar has a point I remember watching this trailer and being so hyped and excited.
ooooooooo
 @heheooof5670  nah
Feels like a lie, yet it has..3 years flew by, like nothing
I remember when I watched this the night of it's release with my friend too.
 @TMZV-xe9es  bro he said Aquaman made more money than the iron man trilogy. It didn't even Iron Man 3 alone.
 @heheooof5670  Aquaman didn't even beat Iron man 3 in box office.
 @heheooof5670  no way home will because of tobey maguire
It's  4 going on 5 years actually
Born too late for Star Wars, but born at the right time to witness the MCU. I could still remember when I first saw Iron Man as a small kid
Coming from the future, can confirm that It’s been officially 5 years half a decade after this masterpiece of a trailer. Unreal!!
 @kylie1026  Dark knight, Lords of the rings > MCU
Only goosebumps or Chills also?
Feel like we got  muck up by him came back 5 years
Just got back from being blipped 😂
 @alanher2004  no cuz you came a day earlier then me
Marvel is not the same anymore
​ @punisher3376  yeah but ant man and wasp quantumania???
i will see it tomorow for my firist time
“I’m sorry, that must of been a very long 5 years”
Where did that lead you? Back to me.
Infinity War was such a legendary movie that people come to rewatch its trailer 4 years after its release
It's so cool knowing 20 years from now, we get to look back at and tell our kids that we witnessed cinematic history.
The future will never know how incredible this was
Still gives me the chills.
All y’all talking about the feeling of the first time you watched the movie, I’m over here with the hairs on the back of my neck spiking to a point every time I watch this TRAILER….. TILL THIS DAY….TILL THIS DAAY! I still remember where I was and what I was doing when I was told the trailer dropped and geeking over it with my cousins who I grew up watching the series with since iron man 2. We were connecting the dots to the comics ever since. I still remember the hype for the first avengers. It had never been done before, getting not one not two but 4 major block buster movie titles and putting their characters together for a full length movie plot and all not just a crossover. Connecting the dots was field day back then and now you got infinity war, it was fuckin biblical
Still get chills watching this trailer, probably the best trailer ever made.
When Thanos said fun isn't something you consider when balancing half of the universe but this brings a smile to my face my spine tingled
One of the best movie trailers of all time ❤
Its been so long and yet here we are watching this trailer, reliving the old best days of MCU
I wish i can feel the hype of this movie in past 🥺
After five year still masterpiece👍
'Get this man a shield.'
Even in 2021, still brings the feels.
It still give chills 🙌🏼
Goosebumps, everytime...
Y'all remember how the internet exploded when this was released ? Good memories
The slow motion shot at 2:00 still gives me chills. Great trailer and movie
Who else looks back at this trailer and tears up…🥹🥹
Me in 2017: so pumped up to watch this movie

Me in 2022: crying from nostalgia 😭

EDIT: I can’t believe I posted this almost a year ago! Time flies!!! 😂
In 2023 and I'm here to tell you that this is and will still be one of the best trailers ever made for a film.
Ill never forget the ambiance of the crowd when the movie ended.  Total silence!
Nice pfp
Totally agree, best trailer ever made. But Spiderman NWH's trailer is close second.
 @trxndesign3331  Maybe if they actually showed the other Spidermen in it. But they didn't, so...
 @TAStelevision  Honestly I won't hype myself up because I know I will enjoy the movie without them in it.. but it will be shame if they don't appear. 
2 weeks to go man!! Can't wait
POV: all you watch is capeshit movies
Xmen days of future past trailer and this trailer are best ever
There are a lot of trailers much better than this
 @trxndesign3331  what did you think of it
It's hard to top that days of future past trailer but this is up there
 @n0tdiamond893  Man watched it 6 days ago and I am still blown away, best MCU movie so far and probably best superhero movie of all time
Peter Parker Yes
 @trxndesign3331  lol MCU (not marvel) fanboys are crazy 🤣
Batman tops this trailer
​ @issacadrian122  Batman trailer is great but not even NWH trailer topped this one imo. 
When you get hyped for the movie you watched several times by watching trailer you know it's legendary.
That punch iron man took is crucial and amazing sorrybjust had to be said especially with the trailer music
 @lil_cali714___  "... does put a smile on my face." 
SMACK
We see Hulk in Trailer but we didn't get Hulk in movie in that Scene 😂
clearly didnt watch x men trailer
 @issacadrian122  batman trailer was crap, there was literally no action in the trailer and u can bearly see it because of the darkness
 @cheetodust7647  I smell simping 🧐📸
then you need to watch harry potter 8's trailer
 @burhanali7449  then you need to watch kong skull island trailer
Fun tuber there were rewrites regarding hulk in the last act of infinity war, plus multiple Marvel movies have deceptive edits to prevent spoilers, e.g Thanos only has two stones throughout the whole trailer.
Dont forget endgames Trailer
 @trxndesign3331  batman trailer was the greatest,this was amazing thou
 @barry2349  Batman trailer is sick but the hype around IW trailer was once in a lifetime experience... 4 years ago flew by man
 @trxndesign3331  I mean considering the 10 years wait and all of that yes but in my opnion from a pure film making trailer perspective the batman has the grestest,greatest, guess there both exceptional trailer,iw is a ana amazing moviw
 @barry2349  Lets hope the movie will live up to and exceed the hype
Trueeeeee
The Batman>
Ikr
I remember seeing it in opening day and everyone in the theater started clapping when captain America first appeared
Fun tuber hello new comment
Fun tuber about your question
Its because Movies are very different from trailers they decided to fool the viewer into thinking that everything is going perfectly until they realize...
K mazfronardi ummmm hi?
And they gave him knifes on his hands
oh ye
And then I was disappointed that during the climax of the final battle in Wakanda that we didn't see them running into the forest and Banner didn't turn into the hulk like they showed at the end of the trailer.
Remember watching this at the theatre for the first time that was amazing.Oh my God,goosebumps after goosebumps
Can't believe this was almost 5years ago. I thought Infinity war was released in 2019
 @mikeoxlong7607  That was endgame.
Fr, and I'm worried they're rushing the Multiverse Saga so it won't be as fulfilling as Infinity War and Endgame 😭
Bro we all know how tony sacrificed himself. Let's pay our respects to him
Agreed 💯
I SWORE TO GOD IT WAS IN 2018
 @bassyboy032  2019 actually
 @maximrodriguez5412  I thought it came out in 2019! ITS FCKING 2018 THO
 @maximrodriguez5412  it's 2018
Same 😔
I remember watching this with my family and best friend when it came out. I even bought an Infinity Gauntlet keychain at the cinema I went to watch infinity war (I lost the keychain).
I swear
I remembered when this trailer came after finishing the final exams for towards graduation. I was so hype after exams has finished and trailer came out at the same time.
It hurts so much to see what MCU is doing with its Legacy.
After 2019 MCU😭
💯💯💯💯💯💯
 @maximrodriguez5412  rip Tony 
But IW was better movie
Nonstolgia
 @mikeoxlong7607  the quality after 5 years ago is still insane. Man! it just looks like it was released a year ago!
Facts
*2018:
Same
LITERALY

Facts :((((
 @jshxlot  it was better quality than now
 @Hgh38  yes, those were the days :< mcu is strong back then
 @metrometheus641  infinity war 2*
FACTS
And RIP Chadwick Boseman
Tbf it's not that nostalgic for me somehow
Its barely 5 years and you talk about nostalgia . Stop trying to be old
 @merryaay  I agree
 @danielp4148 just wait patiently they are still working on making quality content 
Believe in Kevin feige he will make secret wars even bigger then this one
Literally crying😭
That's how you end a movie.
Best Marvel movie till date 🙌
Still gives me goosebumps
Looking at this trailer really makes me want DC to build up a Justice League v Legion of Doom event type movie. So much potential, a superhero movie like that has never been done before having many iconic villains altogether on screen teaming up. It could rival Infinity War/Endgame and make billions if done right.
"Dread it, run from it, destiny still arrives." 
Josh Brolin deserve an Oscar for putting life in Thanos. His voice is nothing but masterpiece.
Watching it after 5 years.... Still give me chills🤌🏻... Such a masterpiece created by MCU....  Thanks a lot marvel
It's 2023 but I still feel the goosebumps an epic battle than any marvel movies
1:15 evacuate the city, angage all defences and GET THIS MAN A SHIELD. This line still gives chills in 2023 🥶🥶🥶🥶
Holy crap up until now this one is the best trailer ever made. Goosebumps 🥶🥶🥶
It’s been 5 years 😢
Thanks Marvel for that Masterpiece 🔥
Love You 3000 ❤
Even in 2020, this still is the BEST trailer that I've ever seen!!!
This is the best science fiction movie I have ever watched.
The pace of this movie and they way they showed it, was extraordinary.
It's been 5 year?? Whew what a moment this was when it came out. Who else is watching this because of nostalgia???
5 years later and it's still the best Avengers movie
0:34 the way the theme starts playing gets me hyped everytime
I wish I could relive seeing this trailer and movie for the first time.
I still remember the first day this came out. This was all EVERYONE at school was talking about! This trailer gave me chills then, and it still does now.
What a time to be alive as a marvel fan.
This was PEAK cinema nothing like being in the theater watching this for the first time
I MISS THIS MARVEL
Hope we all can get the same feeling of this infinity war vibe on any upcoming new avengers movie again
Yep new good marvel movies come along like nwh, guardians 3, endgame.... and people will claim that it is the greatest marvel movie but after a while that same people will claim that those movies suck or barely top 10 because their effect wear off but Infinity war is different. It stood the test of time and for me it gets better like a fine wine
He also played cable in Deadpool 2
Absolutely, that was peak voice acting. Props to the Digital Effects team too, it was artistry.
 @iarrived731  As Deadpool will always remind us.
I fully agree with you
James Lough I never listen to critics I only listen to fan reviews
Thanos comment on this comment now
1000th like
I don't think you understand Oscars
 @jothishprabu8  yeah right. And I don't want to understand. Specially from you.
James Lough maybe critics just hate box office movie
One of greatest cinematic villians ever. They gave Thanos more depth than he had in the comic books.
 @pinakpratimdeb4320 Josh Brolin did good voice acting but oscar nah
 @abdurrahmanfarhan8647  Oscar is just a reference. And it's not only voice my friend. Think about his role, his acting. The role of thanos was just made for him. He's irreplaceable.
Unrivaled. Absolutely unrivaled to this day
 @particularlytrue  the Joker trailers are
Facts!  No debate
This and Logan trailer are the best. :)
Yaa force awakens comes close tho and even bvs comic con trailer too
Trea2030 Joker trailer is much better
FreddyHun 23 nah... and joker is overrated
mmm mmm it won 2 Oscar and 2 golden globe  made 1billion dollar without China and it was R rated
FreddyHun 23 I mean Crash won best picture. So oscars really don’t mean anything(Though I do think Joaquins performance was the best thing about the movie). And as for the 1 billion dollars a movie doesn’t have to be good to make money(i.e. Captain Marvel)
mmm mmm Well captain marvel was released in China had a budget of 152million and it was pg13 while joker was never released in China had only a budget of 55mil and was R rated
FreddyHun 23 My point was that making money doesn’t determine a movies quality (though I still think joker was great)
Cloudatlas, Period
Jokers trailer is so much better
Has anyone seen the Godzilla: King of Monsters movie trailer?
Me too. I've been re watching MCU trailers
Sorry but Logan trailer>infinity war trailer
THIS is the best trailer you’ve seen?! Sorry, but this trailer is kind of trash. Have you seen the two trailers for Godzilla:King Of The Monsters or Kong:Skull Island or the trailers for Star Wars:Rise Of Skywalker or the insanely good trailers for Joker? Lol, there are MUCH better trailers out there.
mmm mmm I really wish that some marvel fanboys could understand that. 

Literally any time that some makes an honest opinion about why they like dc better, some of these marvel fanboys will go out and say “BuT MäRvĘł MāKs Mor Mony THań Dc”
What about “To the End”?
SignedTundra Gaming I know right
 @callm3freddyrandom595  …Horse 💩 it is 😅!!!
Abel Ramos stan u .
Sameeeee. I went to work the next dayx and it was the hot topic around the office.
I went for the first day first show and the feeling was just awesome man!!🤗
Abel Ramos same, just watching it 2 years after the movie came out makes remember the hype..... good times
That day was my first day in my first job. Very important day for me.
I still remember that this is the trailer that made me jump to being a Marvel Fan from Star wars
can't relate at all
The hype was real. Even my friends that had no idea about marvel came with me at the cinema
Same but I think most if not the only chills that come from this are due to Spider-Man and his spidy sense
You could say it, put a smile on your face?
JediTy2007 YES!
2023 I’m rewatching this trailer and I feel like having a good cry from the nostalgia..it was a time to be alive and peak cinema experience
1:17

THERE WAS AN IDEA...I still come back to watch this like its the first time 🤩🤩🤩🤩
We are missing a super villain like Thanos in MCU...
The hype was unreal❤
Never get bored from this one!
This will forever be my favorite MCU film of all time!
Me watching this trailer 3 years later: Some people move on, but not us.

edit: holy crap 4 years
Let's make this the most watched trailer again!
this might just be the best movie trailer ever, 5 YEARS later and its still so hype
Peak of MCU even after 5 years❣️
I know there are more powerful villains than Thanos but the way they built Thanos up in the MCU to be a super villan going to be untouched in the next 2 decades.
How has it already been 5 years? Seems like only yesterday I was watching this trailer over and over again. Now the MCU is completely falling apart. RIP Stan Lee. You are missed by many!
Can't believe it's almost been 4 years....  I remember being so hyped when I saw that this came out.  Time flies man
Who else still gets chills,and remembers where they were when they watched the trailer for the firsr time
I don’t no if I’m alone but watching this trailer make me so nostalgic of the golden age of marvel that I wanna cry 😢😢❤️
The most hyped film and where has Marvel reached at phase 5
One of the greatest movies ever made
Still Goosebumps
Honestly i would trade a fortune just to get that feeling of hype when i saw this and Endgame for the first time
*REST IN POWER

This is the best Avengers movie then Endgame
same
I still did when I saw it for the third time. Planning to see it a fourth and a fifth
Me too
Agree the hype for infinity war was insane its sad its been this long. Time flies
the first trailer for infinity war... that excitement
God me too
That's was crazy. I've never felt so hyped like when I watched this movies..
Completely agree with you man
Probably the Last Time in the next years
Yes dude
Saammeeeee I'm not sure I will feel this way again honestly just glad to be apart of all this 😆😆🔥
1000th like
So trueeeee
So would I. Without question.
Yeah me too keep coming back here just to remind myself the feeling that I got when this trailer came out
true. i was lowkey more hype seeing this trailer than endgame
Legit the exact thing I was thinking when watching this trailer
Me too
I would trade fortinite for a chewing gum
I refuse. To let
😾
fr i thought i wqas the only one who missed being this hype for a movie i literally had dreams of watching endgame before it came out
Fr
I wasn’t as big of a marvel fan as I am now so it wasn’t as good as hype for me. I wish I was a big fan at that time.
The best of all of the MCU movies so far. It was finally a movie where the villain WINS!
This STILL gets me so excited
Infinity War is almost becoming 5 years old now..
I come here to remind myself life can be awesome too...what a time to be alive
Man some of the best super hero movies EVER.
5 yrs ago this gem dropped. The first time I watched it, I remember getting goosebumps, not once or twice but as many times as I watched this trailer...
In my opinion, I think that movie is impossible not to cry too.
still goosebumps after 5 years
this and infinity war are so iconic. Nothing has topped them in the whole mcu since
I had an exhaisting day. But this... this does put a smile on my face
Peak MCU - I'm worried we'll never be back to this level again.
Anyone else just wanna time travel back to where this trailer first came out just to see all the hype for it?
El mejor trailer de la historia
me watching this after endgame and now 2 other movies of Avengers are going to come out... this feeling is dam awesome... even though these last movies have been rought and sad i will still be a big big biggggg fan of marvel ❤️❤️
Everything changed after this movie, not just the movie, but life.
One of the few times a movie lived up to the trailer.
Anyone still watching after 5 years such great memories
This and Endgame was the most hyped up movies I've ever been to. It felt like everyone was an avenger when we all went to see the movie together, as if we were going to fight a big war. Dang do I miss 2018 and 2019 for movies like this. I love them both, but I'm glad we have Spiderman NWH to somewhat bring that back
It's 2023 but it still gives goosebumps!
I miss this so much this movie was a feeling
Got goosebumps just now
Once in a lifetime movies
Nicks Furys first words in this trailer from the first Avengers still to this day bring me goosebumps
But no "chills" like KGF 🤣
 @spc9531  bruh shut up kgf is Indian.  We are talking about Hollywood marvel
 @spc9531  kgf was not even 0.0000001 percent of infinity war
Kgf/ kgf2 both are biggest piece of dog sh**
Same here. Every time
I m still getting it ❤️❤️
I came back from dead
In my book, I rank the movies based on goosebump moments
I was so hyped still gives me chills to this day glad to witness it
It's my first time rewatching this after all this time and I still got goosebumps 👁👄👁
 @summoned_skulll9480  it's my hopefully last time I get replies from this comment but most likely not
Xd
It was legendary. Nothing can come close probably ever again.
It was absolutely insane I dont think Ill ever see a trailer get so many views and hype in just 24 hours And the chiiills
Use the time stone to return back
oh god yes
Just use the quantum portal... simple!
ZB - Taiatini I remember watching this the day it came out in school. It was 2nd period and everyone was freaking out
ZB - Taiatini yess
Honestly when the trailer was announced I didn't even bother wat ching it nor did i think I'd ever like watching super hero movies. But I saw the movie and was honestly shocked at how good it was and honestly i was rooting for Thanos. This one is definitely the best Avengers movie by far.
ZB - Taiatini yep that’s exactly why I’m watching this 2 years after it came out
We just have to wait 50 years and maybe just maybe we can go back to see it 🙂😌
I wish I could time travel back to the year between Infinity War and Endgame when EVERYONE was talking about it. That was the year of memes. The hype for Endgame was amazing. Except for when it first came out and these kids at my school were spoiling everything. I feel really bad for future kids who will never get the experience of the MCU. And I get you can watch the movies, and it's still amazing and a big deal, but nothing can top the excitement of seeing Endgame and Infinity War and cheering in the theaters and crying in the theaters and walking out of the theaters having an existential crisis. Nothing can beat counting down the exact days and hours until Endgame came out. Nothing can beat being able to randomly bring up anything from the movie and everyone knowing what you were talking about because they all watched it too. And I also feel bad about other movies, too. I feel like the biggest movies ever have already come out. ex. Star Wars, How To Train Your Dragon, MCU, Wonder Woman, Pirates of the Caribbean. Infinity War and Endgame weren't just movies. They were events.  That's why the MCU is probably the greatest form of art ever made. The characters are all so developed, complicated, and make mistakes like real people. They deal with real issues in the movies, too, like Tony reacting to learning that Bucky killed his parents, and how a whole motivation for the Vulture was losing his job because of the messes being cleaned up. They never talk about how the superheroes have made messes while saving the world in other movies. Even though the MCU isn't exactly realistic, it still kind of is. Some people might say that it's not realistic because they crack jokes all the time and if it were real they'd be so scared, but I would argue that's realistic because people often joke. After all, it's easier than showing you're scared. It's a great way to cope. Anyway, I don't know where this is going. I guess I was trying to say that the characters feel like real people and they really make you care about them. It also helps that every actor in the MCU is perfect for the role and they could never ever be replaced. (I mean, RDJ is basically just playing himself.)
Just remember it it was great time to be alive
Yeah, but if I do that then that's gonna remind me of the huge disappointment I had when leaving my Theater.
Yea but now it kinda felt similar with No way home which was also an incredible movie
 @skyrrmish868  True... the thing is I was more scared of spoilers in Endgame then both Infinity and NWH
Farhan Ibn Liban Al-Geel I got NWH spoiled for me
Farhan Ibn Liban Al-Geel Yes 😔
Aunt mays death was spoiled for me
Spider-Man no way home was mid though
Facts, It was like we all came together to watch a great movie regardless of being Team Cap or Team Tony
احل علم احل سنة not for me it was a complete surprise I was so sad
This dude Watches Youtube nwh $1.5 billions defeat avenger 1 in box office
it happen during worse covid era+ no china released 

based on these records nwh epic vibe just the greatest of all time 

before covid it would over $3 billions
Every fan is great in its own way but together we are a great fanbase. Just Like The Avengers are perfect when all together
اهل علم اهل سنة I just read your comment and now Iron Mans death is spoiled for me 🤣 oh well I would've found out sooner or later
Spider man no way home isnt really close to it tho, its just a mix of old people. Great movie, but nothing outstanding about for me other than watching andrew and Toby return
 @SquidCena  Lmao same
Cringe
 @Onepieceistheworstfuckinganime  Your name 💀💀💀💀
Dis kid prolly didn't watch 1 episode of one piece
 @aadhyarastogi833  At least say something that isn’t corny. I read 551 chapters and drop that trash so think before you comment nonsense.
 @Onepieceistheworstfuckinganime  Lmao ok
 @Stxmm  I feel you. On hindsight, I don't remember much about the movie, but I have to say that it's my best ever theatre experience, even better than Infinity War and Endgame. The last Marvel movie I watched in theatres before No Way Home was Endgame, so it was like nearly a 3 years gap. I was late to the theatre and by the time I got into my seat, Murdock caught the brick. The audience already started screaming, and did so every 5 minutes. Every Marvel movie has this different style, and carries the weight of all it's preceding movies. I had forgotten that feeling but I got it all back during that movie. I can't explain it but it really felt so good, as if you're meeting an old friend after a long time. The experience was my best because I watched it with my friends and turned the theatre into a stadium. I had watched IW and Endgame with my family, so I didn't scream that much.
Infinity War, Black Panther, and Endgame definitely made everyone a fan of the MCU at my high school. I still remember when everyone used to talk like they’re were from Wakanda for a month when Black Panther was released.

Good times
 @fbi855  Dang, man do I miss high school and I remember being in 9th grade and so on, talking to everyone about marvel movies and showing memes
 @sushitrashisnoob7682  same I hate people on twt
Yeah bro
 @arishemthejudge6780  Yeah nwh was still hyped and good. But infinite war and endgame hit different, didnt Get to watch infinity war in the cinema tho. Regret it so much
 @fbi855  i remember during 2018 when Everyone was like wakanda for every just cuz black Panther. That movie hit different
Infinity war is not a “this.”
Still the greatest trailer of all time.
Still my goosebumps are activated
Feeling the goosebumps 💀
" It's Hard To Forget Someone"
" Who Gave You So Much To Remember".

                 - RIP Black Panther 😢🙏
This song and words in starting of the trailer is awesome and only can feel by true Marvel fan ❤️🥺
I’ll give anything to experience something like this again
I wish that opening of the characters's narration talking about the Avengers Initiative was still used in the movie. I would like to hear the Avengers actually use that little speech. Perhaps in Kang Dynasty or Secret Wars. Perhaps Spider-Man can hear it. Or all the younger heroes training to be the Young Avengers. But overall, I think it should be used in the actual final MCU/Avengers film. I know we don't know when that could possibly ever happen. But I feel like it would be a nice way to bring things full circle. Picture it. The movie starts and the screen is just pitch black. Then we hear Nick Fury giving the whole speech and then is when the Marvel Studios logo happens. Or the speech can happen over the logo. Another way it can happen is that we see Nick Fury all alone and getting ready for the biggest battle they are ever going to face and while that happens, we hear the narration.
Man it’s been 5 years and this movie is still a master piece to bad it was one of your last
I don't know how many times I watched this 🎈♥️
This is honestly one of the best trailers of all time.

 I've watched Infinity War multiple times now and I still get hyped watching this in 2019.
Still give goosebumps 🎉❤❤❤
God please let me go back and experience this again!!!!! Man what a time 😢
Can’t believe this is now almost 6 years ago! Awesome movie.
after 5 years still goosebumpsss
ITS Been 5 Years , Many Good Movies have came along the whole period but just waiting for another master piece like this MARVEL WE ARE WAITING for another one like this nowadays the feel is not same sab badal gaya hai HOPE THAT FUTURE IS GOOD LIKE OLD ...................................................................
This movie was amazing and still is and forever will be...
I came to watch the trailer again 5 years after its initial release. Wow.
If they put it on Cinemas Again The Seats Will still be Full🔥
Still a masterpiece.
Almost 6 years yet i get goosebumps
We don't do that here 😭
RIP CHADWICK BOSEMAN

Kabuto I’m your master orochimaru
Omg me to! But everytime i watch it i cry... i dont cry alot sooo those are rare moments for me...
I still remember being blown away by the 300 trailer
I Agree and especially that avengers theme comes it gives me goosebumps everytime 😍😍.
Same here
Your like my dad
If not, then the best
Seems like after Infinity War and End Game ended Phase 4 because Phase 5 movies and shows have been meh compared to this
Yes you right
Better than Avengers Endgame
 @bero1601  It is better overall but endgame had to exist to complete infinity war
Stylie473 Joker has infinity war is still better than endgame
Endgame is way better
True
 @macariohernandez2604  explain, is it because of the final battle? Because the start of endgame was rather dull, infinity war on the other hand was never boring through out the entire film
 @username.exenotfound2943  Exactly my thought too first half of endgame was necessary but dull and like i said it needed to happen to redeem the heroes who siezed to exist in infinity war, for me the ending in tony stark's funeral blessing and heartwarming to see everyone there together and final battle was amazing too
endgame and infinity war are one movie and you guys are still comparing it they had to split both so you know give people hype and box office moneh
To be honest, personally it was more shocking than endgame.
For all of y’all saying how IW is better than Endgame cuz of the action, we know 😐. U can’t have a villain decimate half the universe with the heroes remaining that couldn’t do anything to stop it. They put character development into heroes so your not gonna get a whole bunch of action ALL the time, sorry. They’re both basically one movie anyway so there’s no need to compare. They are EQUAL😁. Endgame may not have had as much action but it was enough to finish the Infinity War story.
Yes
 @mazikeensmith9135  I don't think they are a single movie. There are many differences between one part and another.
 @amercarroll1743  No, both films have too many differences to consider them a single movie. Also, I don't think that's the reason why many prefer Infinity War. 
For me IW is better because it is more intense. There were many moments when I thought the characters would die (and it turned out that I was correct). I felt that Thanos was an enemy that they could not defeat (this also turned out to be correct). Endgame, except for the beginning and the climax, is a walk in the park. The protagonists are supposed to feel devastated by what happened but they don't stop making jokes and having fun while doing the most important mission of their lives.
Ratchet Achenbach but I do see your point.
 @amercarroll1743  But Endgame's jokes completely break the supposedly depressing atmosphere. The ones from Infinity War work a lot better even though it's a much darker movie than the sequel.
Ratchet Achenbach no they don’t. They lighten the mood in SOME parts of the movie. For the most part the beginning is a pretty grim tone.
 @amercarroll1743  From the appearance of Professor Hulk all the scenes have jokes. Only the beginning has a really serious atmosphere. And like I said, my problem is not the jokes themselves but how they break the tone.
Ratchet Achenbach I mean the whole movie can’t be depressing :/  I personally liked the tone change but it’s your opinion I respect it 🤝
 @evertheeverlasting9330  but the impact still meant more in endgame.
 @Ratchet2431  endgame only jokes when its okay. no one was joking when tony stark died. Heck, in the first and third act there isnt really many jokes
this movie is a masterpiece
I liked it more than Endgame even though I don’t like much super action in movies. Also the time travel made me so confused.
Also endgame
Is there a Season 2??
 @Ratchet2431  IW maybe better but idk something about endgame is better than IW and i prefer it a bit more
Yeah the movie came out on my birthday
amo eles
Fully evolved kermit the frog it was dull because it was supposed to happen right after IW. It’s better to watch Infinity war and Endgame back to back. That way the beginning of endgame feels much better
Low standards
Yess there’s still avengers loveress me Tooo WHAT EVER IT TAKES
yeah, it had flaws like tonal inconsistency but overall was good, endgame on the other hand, sucked
 @macariohernandez2604  infinity war is much better than endgame
Avengers Endgame didn’t feel like a part two to Infinity War, it felt empty, and it didn’t have that many hype moments like Avengers Infinity War had, remember when Thor entered Wakanda?
man im telling you watched this movie 32 times
Rare Videos by Javier Vargas TV! People don’t even know how relevant this will age
I wonder how many of you will come back month after month to say the same thing.
 @stylie473joker5  don't forget to see Captain America, as a old man. And to get with girly.
 @username.exenotfound2943  I actually prefer the first 2 hours to the last hour, because it was so emotional and touching and funny and heartfelt. I loved the fact that the movie took time for everyone to feel the effects of the snap, and that it wasn't too fast or slow.
Avenger 2012 is still the best
eh pacing was off i thought end game definitely was good
U can’t complete the avengers quadrology without teh original iron man hulks captain America’s
It was Alr better than end game tho end game was a let down
Rian Johnson ruined the trilogy
Actually this movie should be rewarded as the best movie in the Oscars....!!
 @bero1601  dude both are equal....
you're goddamn right !
no i think it’s pretty trash
 @apheun  anime is like more garbage
 @russiankodiak6849  its like Thor entrance happened in EG. Bcoz they are one movie
Why all are comparing IW and EG? They both are same movie. Something happened in IW doesn't necessary it should happen in EG. IW is first half and EG is second half. EG was slow bcoz it was the aftermath of IW. If we see it as a one movie it will feel like Thor's entrance happened in EG and Cap lift the mjoilner in IW.
U forgot Marvel Avengers endgame
 @bero1601  endgame is so better tf
Agreed 100%
Amen
 @bero1601  no bro engame is..... i dont ave words....its awesome then infinity war
 @tomclancy6174  Honestly, both are amazing! But the only thing I hate about endgame is the way the directors changed the look of thor and hulk... I mean they really suck!!! The big fans of thor and hulk hated them after watching endgame, but to be more clearer the big fans of hulk hated him after infinity war.
 @bero1601  I actually cannot separate the two. They, for me are one movie.
 @vagrantodyssey4736  That is your opinion, and I totally respect it.
 @bero1601  always appreciate the respect :)
3000
TG Mathias Explained thank u. I've seen comments on YouTube saying infinity war it's better. I'll say for sure it kind of is for the character intro part. But to me I like the avengers when they win not when they lost or even comes close to winning but lost. But to me endgame is still better
 @username.exenotfound2943  I think the whole point for endgame is to make us audience think all hope is lost even tho 2018 thanos died, but hope and I mean hope not hope van dyne, came back to slim the chance when Scott discovered a possible time manipulation due to being stuck in the quantum realm for only 5 hrs. That's why there are not a lot of action in the movie but it's still a lot better than infinity war. It also gives us a glimpse of the back to back archival footage of the past mcu film that we didn't get to see in the past. Remember NO STAIRS. And also Tony gets to have a chance to have a heartwarming father-son moment with 1970s Howard bc Howard died in civil war after his argument with 17 year old Tony. Also Steve finally got his dance that he's been waiting for 70 yrs

I gotta be honest. I was soooo hyped when infinity war came out. I was so obsessed with the movie. But in endgame I was hyped but no as much as infinity war. And I also liked infinity war more by like only a little bit
KGF chapter 2 teaser will break this record.
Am i the only one who thinks this music sound like outro: tear
Said no one ever
 @stylie473joker5  honestly i remember thinking this a lot when it first came out, but after recently watching it again, my opinion kinda changed. It's no Infinity war i'm not arguing that i think Infinity war is better. However I think the first half of endgame has some great moments,  that really help make that movie. Cap in the elevator, Thor proving he's still worthy is really great because of how they sell his trauma, so when he gets Moljnir back its a great moment. Plus we get to see characters like Tony and Nebula in intimate scenes together which is unique to endgame. If i sound argumentative know its not my intent, anyone who reads this ily homie take care of yourself, have some water, im rooting for you.
why
 @bigben3922  Bro you're frickin awesome i like how you think and i agree with everything you said, people nowadays seem to ignore the little details that matter and have a greater purpose so yeah you're right
 @stylie473joker5  thanks man! Exactly! Time to go watch both of them again lmao
 @afro_ninja234  Which one?
 @eliwilliams238  infinity war
 @stylie473joker5  I 100% agree.
 @bero1601  extreme facts !
Best film in the MCU 
Behind it Gotg 1 and 2 and Endgame
 @username.exenotfound2943  exactly
Infinity War + Endgame is the best hands down 🙌🙌. A big 6 hours of epic event movie.
 @bero1601  Way better
 @stylie473joker5  Yeah
Yess
Yes, today I was watching it fo the 9,638,526 time.
 @deepakmohan461  So? Will it be as memorable as Infinity War? You do know it's only popular in India, right?
 @heisenberg1648  No you are wrong, You see KGF chapter 1 and 2 reaction/ reviews do by the foreigners on Youtube.
 @deepakmohan461  Compare the reactors of Infinity war trailer with Kgf. You will know what I am talking about.
 @heisenberg1648  Oh let's see.
 @Chuked  yeah that’s what he said why repeat it
Kgf 2 trailer will break just wait and see
Way better than ENDgame
Guys stop comparing Endgame and IW they are literally the same movie they are both good! Please stop comparing and enjoy them!
 @macariohernandez2604  ik
endgame is literally the best movie I have ever watched infinity war is still very good😁😁😁
is this movie better than endgame
 @foodreacts837  no
True
 @bero1601  This
wish i could go back in time
100
 @bero1601  IT IS BUT, ENDGAME DID GROSS MORE MONEY
 @Chuked  IT HAS MORE TRAILER VIEWS
 @foodreacts837  and?
 @username.exenotfound2943  i like endgame more because it gives the characters more time to grow and develop as characters not like infinity war where the only thing i saw in it was death and fighting
just look at it this way atleast steve got his dance with peggy
U right
It will be forgotten with time becouse only real culture lives on and this is not that
 @username.exenotfound2943  imo, Infinity War was the better overall movie, but Endgame is better if you're a die hard marvel fan.
 @xcell5215  the way i always saw it, you can watch infinity war on its own with little knowledge of the mcu, i just think its a better film, endgame however requires you to understand everything for the best experience and even then i was still bored untill the final fight, had they made thanos arrive there with the infinity stones to stop the avengers then it would have been Better (this would require 2018 thanos to be alive though)
wow
 @stylie473joker5  No, Infinity war only exists to justify the existence of the most successful cash grab ever aka Endgame
true one of the best supherhero movies .
I thought that was shrek
 @emopenguin  lol
 @bero1601  ugh, it's one big movie. Infinity war is part 1 and endgame part 2.
Avengers ❤👍
Its funny that 20 years later they will reboot it
I dont think that would be an event like this in years
Just if you watch all movies before in order cause otherwise it does not make any sense.
JLOCC comics has nothing to do with this saga, its different
JLOCC i dont understand what youre saying tbh
JLOCC than why did you waste time here explaining something pointless here?
 @mazikeensmith9135  it would be 5 hours
JLOCC like what did they bring from comics, cause i "never" read them
JLOCC im talking about major events and not about some action things that happen like A LOT of times in ALL this comics.
So based on this few you mentioned you dont need to watch other movies before Infinity War/Endgame?
How old are you?
 @bero1601  stop the cap
Yea it’s amazing but I rlly wish it was slower paced
I Don't Understand What You All Are Trying To Say ?!??!!?
 @afro_ninja234  me too
 @bobyjay5643  yoo thats sick
 @afro_ninja234  ikr
 @Ratchet2431  glad to see somebody get it,personally I call iw,marvel infinity war,since is not just a Avengers movie but mcu crossover and I like it bc iw is more serious and deaths are less forced for sake of the plot
oh
 @Chuked  yeah he said that.
 @idontreadreplies.252  i wrote that six months ago and i still feel the same... infinity war was the greatest cinematic moment of my entire life and it inspires me to be a filmmaker one day
CC_Caleb14 Gaming ok
 @stylie473joker5   A movie doesn't need to be like super hype and high risk through the movie to be better than a more character driven movie, which Endgame was, therefore it is better
Who tf are you
 @macariohernandez2604  your objectively wrong
You got games on yo phone?
This trailer was totally misleading. I really don't want to get into the specifics. But if you don't know what I'm talking about then you never will. I'm talking trailer now.
 @jpotent1019  yup hulk, I also thought the flashing light in the wakanda fight seen was quicksilver
 @ranmindyt2902  Yes!! So how can I watch this trailer and think, "good times, good old memories" when you see that and think how misleading it is. But they really disrespected Stan Lee in this movie. What's worse, this trailer was made when Stan Lee was still alive but when he died, they changed it! Now, why?
 @jpotent1019  I don’t know man it’s just good to look back at the movie.
 @ranmindyt2902  it is for fun I guess. Nothing wrong with that.
No it won't be. You must be a millennial? Because if you ask any real fan, they'll tell you. But if you don't know something, then yeah it was a great movie.
Endgame had to be done the way it was: Seriously, how could they have placed more fighting/action/excitement in Endgame? They just lost half of their life force, so obviously that would cause a lot of "downtime" in the film. But necessary to develop the plot and bring everyone together for the fight in the end. It's also the last film in phase 3 and I think they did a great job in re-visiting big moments from the past films. And of course "Avengers assemble" which we were all waiting for,  and "I am Iron Man" had to have been saved for the the last and best moment(s). Endgame is a banger!
 @StretchDub  Let me start by saying this: The movie is ok. It's a good time passer. I'd watch it if there was nothing else on. But what I'm telling you is, that this movie is not accurate at all. If I didn't know anything about the comics, cartoons, anime, video games or whatever, I'd say what everybody else is saying...that this is a PERFECT movie. But I do know my history and this movie is completely inaccurate.
 @jpotent1019  Well ya hasn't all the films prior to this one been pretty much inaccurate? That's y the comics r the comics and the mcu is the mcu. They're done differently type a thing.... The mcu is comic inspired thats all. Even in WandaVision and FalconxWinter..... They're based on certain comics but they've put their own spin on it. Even in Endgame when Hulk was holding up the headquarter building as it was collapsing... I know that was a comic ref.... So they still honor Stan Lee's legacy n stuff u kno.... And Im sure Stan Lee was proud for what the mcu has done

I
 @StretchDub  Man, HELL NO! How in the world are they honoring SL by putting their own spin on it?? That crap wasn't approved and they know it. In case you don't know, SL didn't even like Tom Holland as Spiderman! Want to know why? Because they made him soft as hell! It's cool to make their own storyline, that's ok. But weakening certain heroes is out the question.
 @jpotent1019  Okay maybe im wrong about them honoring SL them. But
Tom Holland is soft? Is it cuz "his" spiderman is goofy, and immature? Cuz thats what im likely to expect from a teen. And didn't he take on Vulture head on? And the way he lifted the rubble that he was buried under. And he stopped Winter soldier's punch with one arm(im not sure how strong W.S. is) but still....
One thing i was surprised on was how bad Hulk got beat by Thanos.... And then he was afraid to come out later in the film..... Im not sure if that happened in the comics but that imo is turning Hulk soft as hell lol!
 @jpotent1019  Yeah the mcu made a lot of characters goofy/added humor to them. Thor is another one. But wait.... How is this Peter not a genius? Didn't he impress Tony Stark with his self designed web shooters once Tony saw it for the first time? And in Far From Home, didn't we see him orchestrating that same level tech that Tony was using?
 @StretchDub  You're kidding right? I can't believe you don't know this or even saying this. That's something they made up. But here's the thing, to be honest, Tony Stark in reality has nothing to do with Peter Parker. Especially making his suit and then taking it away and giving it back. Etc etc. Peter Parker ALWAYS made his own suits! He never needed Tony Stark. Spiderman is really Spiderboy. This new kid is sorry. Not how Peter Parker is supposed to be. They should've gotten someone a little older.
 @jpotent1019  Well i guess its another one if those things that marvel chose to change up.... We had Toby Maguire, and Andrew Garfield that we portrayed spiderman differently.... And now Tom who is also different. I don't see whats wrong with the change. I'm aware that their movies aren't part of the phases in marvel, but we still got to see Spider-Man in various manners. Why they chose someone so young is beyond me, but at least we'll be able to see him grow and be on that character development journey with him
KARTIK SINGH Yeah i guess u can say that
 @StretchDub  You say what's wrong with change? Tell me, what's wrong with consistency? Why do you think people are always saying how the old is always better than the new? I'm sure you even said that before. I don't need to see all sides of Spiderman. Just show me one side. Now Toby, so far, is the best Spiderman ever! They stuck to the script with him.
As a DC Fan this movie is a masterpiece
 @darthvader2520  Obviously, they must didn't do anything to your favorite superhero for you to say that.
 @macariohernandez2604  No lmao.
 @macariohernandez2604  endgame was trash
I find The avengers and Age of Ultron to be more rewatchable
tbh the best avenger show
e
IW and endgame are both magnificent movies, i like endgame better tho
 @bero1601  it had to happen for thor since it wasnt the end of him yet
The trailer is itself a Masterpiece ❤
JUST STOP ARGUEING ABOUT WHICH ONE IS BETTER this is getting so tiring
 @stylie473joker5  only because they did not finish endgame as it should have, with thor killing thanos
Just commenting so it will notify everyone in this thread.
Exelcior
I feel like this comment needs an "amen" at the end.
Yup
Even it’s painful to watch, still a masterpiece
 @stylie473joker5  reading all this feels like avengers endgame is a bad thing
 @bero1601  same i like infinity war more than endgame
 @username.exenotfound2943  yes
Of course
this movie is timeless
Yeah
 @stylie473joker5  avengers 4 was first to be called infinity war part 2 but then later it was changed to endgame
I like this and Endgame, but I would say Endgame is better!
No matter how many times I watch it . It still gives me chills
MAKE THANOS APPEAR ON A FIGHTING GAME
Yep
Yes it is
Who master do served who’s master do I severed what supposed to say Jesus 😂 so iconic
Dude you embarrassed me front the wizards 😂
Doctor strange oh we’re doing fake names now then I’m spiders man then so classic 😆
 @bero1601  I can’t relate
Hulk- hahaha oh yeah you guys are so screwed now 😂
 @username.exenotfound2943  dull I was in it in the theaters all the way it started killing thanos big shock then showing what is happening after infinity war which I wanted to know then the time travel sequence and the final battle
I personally didn’t like it
Bret hart agrees.
 @bero1601  both are 1 movie great superhero movie ever 🔥
Better then Endgame
Your right it always will be
Me thinking this will be a true story
 @bero1601  q
I am no longer a Marvel Studio fan anymore
Issa vibe
 @leonardolim8976  so much for that hope after watching loki.
 @giornogiovanna6639  which comment of mine did you reply to cuz there's 224 comment and I can't find them
 @leonardolim8976  the one where u said endgame was about having hope.
 @giornogiovanna6639  oh yeah. Well that is true thats what endgame is all about.
My favorite
Frfr
It was actually better than endgame
 @macariohernandez2604  The pace of infinity war is mind blowing and the importance to every character is just awesome
Yee
 @bero1601  Fact
 @bero1601  nope
 @bero1601  like they always said the ending part of any movie is never that good the near end is the best
 @bero1601  if u look at endgame as a seperate movie.. a singular movie then yeah infinity war is way better,
But when you look at Endgame as an end to 22 previous movies then Endgame becomes something more than an individual movie
 @bero1601  there was too much nostalgia years of our childhood being fixed into a climax and the death of Iron Man is what makes endgame better the depth of what happened how many memories we have with this studio the climax of an era it it just Hass to be the best
 @amercarroll1743  I don't even know if it's 'just' the action. I think in IW it was also just super super hype to see all these MCU franchises come together and see characters meet each other and interact. In Endgame it was more of the standard Avengers group, who've alreayd had a bunch of interactions before.
The team-ups in IW feel like very well thought out with who bounces well off each other. In Endgame it's still well thought out, but who's alive feels more like what's best for the story and some character development (like Peter is dead to give a more emotional view on Tony). And generally speaking a lot of ppl also find Thanos less good, which is prob what they wanted to go for, but it might influence how good you find the movie. 
But yeah the interactions in IW really feel like a one time opportunity and moments that you have to cherish because some team-ups might not happen anymore because of Tony, Steve & Natascha being gone f.e. And some we'll just not see in some while (like GotG and Thor).
Yeah, and then they Fked up everything with time travel
Sp Nwh
Am I a joke to you
the only bad thing for me is that thor didnt kill thanos but in endgame iron man killed thanos and i dont like iron man really tbh i mean iron man would be the weakest if he wasent from the stark family
 @macariohernandez2604  its worse than infinity war becuse tony killed thanos if thor killed him i would think its better than infinity war
I just love the pacing in inviting war, its like all action. Its the one mcu movie I have rewatched the most times
AGREED!!
It's the worst one though
 @author5867  Lmao you're dense if you can't see infinity war is the worst. Very very hopeless
W
yes
 @bero1601  Bruh!!! Endgame was still GOOD!!
Endgame is better, infinity war overrated
Endgame and IW are the only 2 Marvel movies to get a score more than 8(8.4)
fax
Yes
This movie will be engraved in American culture for many years to come
After Endgame all the other marvel movies sucked. They can't top the hype Thanos brought and what he represented.
True
Yes...truly and Dc is nothing in front of this...
👌🏻
The MCU will never be the same again, at least we have all these wonderful movies
 @Mhats  this isn't even about Star Wars
'Captain Marvel' is the Worst Marvel Movie Ever..... 👍🏻. 👍🏻.
Even after 5 years people are watching trailer again and again which shows how good this movie is
Life isn't complete without going back to this trailer at least every 3-4 months
Time flies since i watched 5 years ago❤
Those were the days ❤
Can’t believe it’s been 5 years. How marvel has fallen
Still the greatest trailer I've ever seen
It’s been 5 years?? :0
The goosebumps watching this trailer again
The movie that turned movie theathers into football stadium.
The ending was unbelievable, so sad marvel has lost its way.
5 years of this masterpiece
I love how we all come back here after some year later♥️
The coming generations wouldn't know the hype of this.
the nostalgia...
Nostalgic for a Marvel Fan❤❤
We are so lucky to witness these masterpiece movies
Endgame is one of the best mcu movies but the only reason why that movie gain so much money is because of how good Infinity War is.
Infinity war >>>> endgame
This movie was perfect with its script, editing, transition between scenes, and tension-filled music. What was nick fury saying? Oh yes. REMARKABLE.
5 years later just like endgame
Would do anything to go back and watch this for the first time again
In trailor....
Goosebumps in thynos entry 😮
Namor You certainly have awesome weeks then!!
Facts
How about every 2-3 hours
 @meepbeep3998  tbh with you that is kinda unhealthy.

okok I get it. sarcasm.
Nah my life is complete even without watching this trailer for 5 years. I’m built different.
Get this man a life.
Fr fr
Trueeee bro❤️❤️
You are right 👍
 @mariajegan2409  im always right
 @ongoingsneeze7567  lol.
Yeah true
Come to south india u will see theatres in three football stadium effect
 @athul5574  eww
 @classix568  why do you hate india?
 @Draglox  he’s probably jealous
 @justsomeindianwholikesanim8564  of what?
 @Josh-wt5xp  of India
 @Draglox  i'm half indian and i've been to india any sane person knows what dogsh*t that country is, nd if know one agrees then yall just biased
 @devendrarathore1975  bro said he’s Indian 😭
 @classix568  Coming from a guy who is subbed to Logan Paul and still watches Pubg content in 2020, way to go buddy.
 @Batman-bf8ed  lmao
Both this and endgame did that sir
Lol
Shay Haffenden ahh yes man I would do anything for that too being so hyped going back to my excited little kid personality again man infinity war and endgame were great movies
Get the time stone and you can. From what I understand, Tilda Swinton has one locked away in NY
Go watch people's reaction to this trailer, it's not the same as watching it the first time, but it does feel satisfying seeing those people watch it for the first time.
Brian Ombega yeah I do that 🤣
YOU JUST EXPLAINED MY FEELINGS
Yes, you have to admit: if you didn't like "The Last Jedi," this trailer was probably the best thing about being in the theater.
I really regret not seeing this at the theatre before I got spoiled
Shay Haffenden so true
Brush just get amnesia on purpose and tell your friends and family to reintroduce you to the mcu
Whatever it takes
I havent watched even 1 Avengers movie , Also infinity war and end game
 @michalblasko8740  You shouldn't watch any Avengers movies without watching the whole MCU in order, otherwise it won't make sense
Lol
anything? would you drink diarrhea mix with a drunks vomits as a milkshake? you said anything!!
jltaco85 whatever it takes 😭
Shay Haffenden fr dawg
TIME TRAVEL!!!
When I watch infinity war and endgame it was worth the 2-3 hours
same
Yess
You and me both.
Shay Haffenden Yep
For me it would be Endgame and the original Avengers
name the best  scene
 @SandyHathaway  To quote the Joker from The Dark Knight where do we begin
YES FR
Captain Jakemerica 👏🏽
Nah, I don't wanna relive my disappointment all over again...
 @jltaco85  dude what are 12 grow up
To think this movie came out 5 YEARS AGO, still the best MCU ever!!!!
My favourite movie forever 😍
I like that they trick us on certain scenes what’s gonna happen, but the fact that we had 45 seconds of hulk is barbaric
I will miss these legends in upcoming mcu movies❤😢
I’m sorry this is the best trailer ever and it’s not gonna get old.
Still the best trailer of all time.
I can still taste the theatre experience as I am watchimg this trailer. What an experience
That Tony Vs Thanos battle still excites me 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤
I remember being the first in my class to see this, I was like no way and told everyone the trailer was out, our teacher put it up on the projector and we all took a break from class to watch it
This trailer made me so excited for Avengers The Kang Dynasty and Avengers Secret Wars😅…, I can‘t wait for the next Avengers movies!

2026 & 2027 are going to be HUGE years for the MCU
Seeing this trailer after watching Endgame feels soo emotional.
Favorite movie franchise of all time!!
Every time I remember Marvel phase 4 I come back here to revive my dying passion.
Directors who made this coolest art come real,  we GREATLY feel your absence from the later released movies. May your places be forever restored!
back when the MCU hit its peak. it'll never be the same again
Goosebumps trailer
"Fun isn't something one considers when balancing the universe, but this evil chuckle does put a smile on my face." Still one of the best lines, not said in the movie!
This trailer still makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up
One of the greatest movies of all time
,,The end is near"
I’m back 5 years after I was blipped out of existence. What did I miss?
Isaac Moore I agree, I have watched this an unhealthy amount f times
Came here to say just this. Makes me hyped for a film I've already seen.
Lachlan Moyse same and I am not the least bit ashamed
8thofthe8th right. Everything about infinity war was excellent from start to finish.
Right up there with Mad Max: Fury Road and KOTM.
GPChivo 105Spank never was a big fan of Star Wars personally
It will never get old...ever.
Kimberly Brooks it will
 @dmin5782  What's KOTM?
Isaac Moore fr
 @isaacmoore2751  NEVER GETS OLD!!!
What about end game
Ayush Srivastava personally I got more hype when I saw this trailer. Endgame’s trailer had me unsure of whether to get my hopes up about everybody coming back😂
 @ayushsrivastava007  It was good, but wasn't that great as Infinity War's trailer
I watch it in my free time
Jay -.- seriously though
BoyDanny93 Endgame “To The End” trailer was so much more hype
Nope it’s not gonna
ur canadian arn't you?
A Philosophical Theory nope
Agree even the music in the background still gives me chills.
Halo wars 2 trailer was fire but I doubt many people here have seen it. This one is better tho
go watch the trailer of godzilla, you'll change your mind about this being the best trailer
Y U SAYING SORRY 🤦🏻‍♀️
Boss MD wdym
I say endgame one is better but o love both
This trailer is gold
Kellbag I’m a little too young for those I’ve seen all those movies I just didn’t see the trailers. All of the movies are very good though
No this is gonna get old
The lost Gamernaut Yes. I waited so long for these movies, it feels like yesterday when they were announced and now it’s over. Can’t believe it.
The lost Gamernaut bit of a let down JUST JOKING Loved Infinity war and End-game. Until guardians of the galaxy 3 comes out I think for me it’s time to take a break from the MCU. Nothing in the MCU will live up to End-game other than GALACTUS a coming out of nowhere.
and after realising we got baited by marvel
i still got goosebumps watching this trailer omg, end game was an emotional ride😭🔥💯
MCU will never be as good. Idk how to explain it. Avengers is literally the greatest saga of all time and it just can’t be matched without being replicated noticeably
Ikr
しんちゃん大いいよ
I know
Octagon Count true that
I’m glad they cut that line out. Because Thanos did not enjoy his quest of finding the stones. It was painful for him. All he wanted was to find the stones and complete his plan. Which was of course destroying half the universe.
 @southtexasangler  fun isnt something one considers when balancing the universe is a line they should have kept in in my opinion since he is happy that he getting more stones to complete his plan to help the universe even though he only does it to save everyone. Also he's the mad titan and that line is great
 @southtexasangler  2014 Thanos could've said that in endgame.
Wtf i just realised he didn't say it
South Texas Angler bro what are you talking about it’s a badass line no he didn’t enjoy the quest but he smiled at the end when he watched the sunrise they could’ve had him say it to all the avengers after he beat them or something
He says something kinda similar in endgame, about ending our stubborn annoying planet
​ @southtexasangler  It was not painful for him to balance the universe. He was brutal and without mercy, See the scene when he crushes Loki's neck. Although killing civilians was not "personal" for him, He took a liking to beating those "ungrateful" in his crusade of claeansing. Only through the sacrifice of Gamora sees how taking a life really matters, you could say that when he fights Ironman and Starlord's crew he is a diferent person
I wanna go back to these times bruh. Had me so excited
Who else came back here just to feel the spirit again
“Dread it, run from it, destiny still arrives” the most truthful quote I’ve ever read
Can we go back in time to relive the Incredible Hype for this movie
Can’t believe it’s been 5 years. Time flies
2:02 piel de gallina
I miss those good ol’ days of the MCU, when it was at it’s peak, when it wasn’t like a Disney XD channel
still one of the best trailers.
The fact that this movie is almost two years old now... Jesus man, I remember the hype.
I can‘t believe it’s already 5 years old…, I remember how crazy everybody was about this…, I‘m already so excited for Avengers The Kang Dynasty and Avengers Secret Wars
14 april 2023......STILL GOOSEBUMPS 💓💓
Still remember this mind blowing trailer❤❤❤
One of the best trailer of all time ❤
who still watching this masterpiece?
This is hands down (still) the best trailer Marvel has ever produced.
STILL one of if not the BEST MCU trailer so far...
Endgame don't even get close to this MASTERPIECE.
I would do anything in my hand to watch this for the first time
I wish i can eraser memories to watch it again for the first time love you 3000 ❤
MCU was on its peak at this time. i still get goosebumps on rewatching this
Hello there
thanos is the joker of the marvel universe
"we live in a society"
When you find out your getting older
 @jockeyfield1954  « we live in a multiverse »
Homework be like:
Happening all around world
 @jockeyfield1954  what's the deep meaning behind that quote ???
 @justchilling177  it is just for taunting the society and it's stereotypes
 @ghostghost9533  no i was talking about the joker's quote.
Take it easy
These are corona lines
IRS be like:
Thank you Chunky Kong
@J0HNNY S31ZUR3, everybody was hyped
Who wasn't hyped
I watched this trailer so many times, it's still amazing
Me too
Endgame hype was more better but this hype was still good
natcan17 agreed, but this helped raise the bar. Endgame wouldn’t have been as hyped without the stakes this film set in motion.
 @johnnyseizure8098  wouldn't that count with all the previous movies because without iron man there would be no infinity war hype, hell there were be no infinity war
natcan17 that’s semi arguable but you’re right.
5 years ago it was still had 3years to this movie and it was too much but now it's in our mind at this bad days
You don’t know hype unless you were alive when Halo 3 came out, but looking at your PP you probably were
I remember coming home from school and getting the notification and just running around my house excited. I saw it opening weekend and I got the best theater. Nobody roared for character appearances or call backs so I was able to hear every little thing.
Bro, you brought the hype memories back. Thankss♥️. NO Words for it
Cae9.v No problem my dude
Same
This is not a movie this was a world wide event of hype for 10 years lol god I wish I could go back in time to relive this
Black panther 2 (may) will beat it
 @hx20games77  exactly
AJ agreed, I think age of ultron is their best trailer but this is a close 2nd.
I agree. This has power.
Civil War was something special too
 @hx20games77   Black Panther 2 Trailer 1 is my pick.
No way home
 @hx20games77  no
Unfortunately Endgame & No Way Home are tied for that spot.
This trailer still gives me the CHILLS.
still the best trailer ever made . with dolby and full volume . make me feel that fear of thanos
5 years still it's best teaser i have ever seen i am Lucy to witness mcu
Unpopular opinion: this is the best Marvel movie ever.
-non-stop action
-pure nerdgasm 
-2 best superhero entrances (cap-cold and thor-nerd dream)

Only thing that drag it down is defeat at end.
Who else is revisiting... all of you are awesome.. I wish we all can watch this movie again in theatre❤❤
I wish i could experience it for the first time again
When you still remember each line of this trailer

"Im still worthy"
Remember when comic movies were some what serious and not about jokes and twitter wars i almost cried watching this again
We'll tell our kids about this movie....how the climax turned the theater into a stadium.
"Perfectly Balanced, As All Things Should Be." - Thanos
God I miss the old days 😢
Legit may be the greatest trailer to a movie ever.
Who else can’t believe it’s been 2 years since this came out
I remember I watched this one on release day, first session of the day. It was 12:00 AM and the theater was so crowded I had to get to my seat 20 minutes earlier.
This still hits after years
Proud to be the person of this infinity era❤
Watching this trailer in 2023, now that does bring a smile to my face.
Marvel's masterpiece.

They're never gonna top this even if they try 20 times.
My father was a whole marvel fan. We watched the first iron man movie and never missed a single one. But on 2018 Valentine's Day, he passed away in an accident. I wished we could see infinity war and endgame together. 

I miss u dad. Thank you marvel entertainment for everything.
This was marvel's prime, the days when they spend time on character depth, plot and visual effects. Now they are rushing so many movies with great potential
Yau are not alone
that's what i was gonna say, it' soo good
I wish I could erase my memory of seeing this movie so I can re watch it again..regardless awesome franchise and re watch them anyway haha
 @tnt_tshamala1039  yo what's up with Annabeth? Y'all make any Seaweed kiddos yet lmao
 @thegoliath9310  You know we busy in the bed. 6 months left 🤣
 @tnt_tshamala1039  lmao. Grover still around?
 @thegoliath9310  Nup haven't seen him in ages
i keep coming back just to hear the narrations of nick fury and thanos
Yeah I liked this movie better than endgame honestly. I wish they would have shown the shot where they all run forward together. Why wouldn't they show that?
Yep! Me too.
Same
tbh i only listen to the song THAT gives me the goose
The part where Thanos lays out Iron Man still gets me.
Hi Lucy, i am necraze
Its not an unpopular opinion, the unpopular opinion is your sentence in the end. Its good to have a dark ending after all this time because heroes always end up winning in the end and it kinda gets lame at this point. Thats why in my opinion Infinity war is the greatest superhero movie of all time
More like the movie
 @abdelrahmanamr651  more like the entire MCU
lmao
😂🔥🔥
"I knew it"
Fine, I’ll do it myself
i do
Yassss
Mark Mazing “I understood that reference”
😊😊😊
There's still some ppl that still has not watched infinity war😂
 @_quixote  really?
I saw the same comment in endgame trailer 2 month ago
kurwitz "i like this one"
We wiil always
So facts
the diamond warrior huge facts
"give this man a shield"
and the music
I do too 😂😂
"More power racoon"
I read that in Thor's voice
Nick gurr lol. I too.... Stern
For real man
It....hasn’t?
Me 😭

And it's going to be a Yr since endgame came out in 4 months
almost 3 🤯
Me
Lmao it felt like a week ago.
You’re lying... right?

oh yeah yeah
I can't either
I was dying for 2 years since 2012 after 2 after 2012 makes it more than 2 years.

3 year
Hell yeah
So sorry to hear that. Stay strong buddy.
So sorry bro I’m sure he would’ve enjoyed them
kickem I totally understand what you were going through. We also watched the first Ironman movie and we would always watch marvel movies together, but he suddenly passed away in March 2018. I would give anything just to see him one more time. Hope you are getting better bro.
Don’t worry, he still saw them 😉 ❤️
i'm sorry to hear that buddy he is watching it up above :)
So sorry brother! He did see it with you, don't worry.
That's so sad
He is with you only
Dark
May his soul rest in peace
May his soul rest in peace. I am sure he is with the true One Above All as we speak.
Im crying omg
Rest in piece you dad
kickem May your father Rest In Peace, stay strong and feel better ✊🏾
L
Anything?  Here in comment section
Is this anything to share and even in this comment section I don't think.
MayDay whatever it takes 😔 😢
I know he's up there chilling with Stan Lee and Chad. Everything will be alright.
stay strong young one
Did he have a favorite superhero?
 @g16-62  Ye iron man, same as mine.. He would have mourned like me when iron man died
kickem mine is the hulk, but I also like other avengers like the sentry and Thor, but hulk is my favorite one. And Robert Downey jr, Stan lee were legends, just like your dad.
 @g16-62  thanks man
Endgame hit me hard after seeing Tony die. He has been a father figure to Peter and that just reminds me of my dad leaving so early.
Rip fam, stay strong he still watches over you.
my condolences. stay strong dude.
Tbh i don’t believe u, like why would u just say that to the internet?
I am sorry dont worry he is still watching with you from above
He's watching marvel in heaven.
R.I.P man❤🙏🏽🙏🏽
Stay strong friend.
He is still with you!! And you love him 3000!!!
Dang bro I’m so sorry for your lost
His father was mad. It’s nice that he......
He must’ve been a hero himself. I’m so sorry
Well, at least he's with Chadwick Boseman aka Black Panther R.I.P
I’m so sorry to hear that!  <3
Dont worry man, hes chillin with black panther and stan lee
Your father is lucky now because he will meet stan lee and king t'challa in heaven..
Man, that's so heartbreaking to hear it, hope you stay strong and forget the past, r.i.p your father😔😔😔
You can always watch them with all of us buddy 💛
Sorry dude that really sucks 😞
So sorry I also lost someone very important to me, it was my aunt and I miss her very very much every night I talk to me and I say what if I did that so she could stay alive.
Kickem stay strong I wish you could at least see those movies with your family
He would have loved both movies 😭
😢I feel bad for you
I am so sorry. Pls do know that your dad is happy and at peace now wherever he is and will always love you and his family and protect you. Just remember to always live up to the person he always thought you could be.
Give everything your best shot, fight for what’s right, take care of your family, and most importantly, always be happy. He would want that. Stay strong buddy. Your dad is proud to have had you as a child. He will always be with you and guide you. Take care ❤️.
This trailer still does the job!
Can't believe it's been five years! Take us back! 🥲
still goosebumps
The hype of this movie unreal to imagine today .
It's almost like a tradition to come back to this trailer once every while.
Masterpiece
Never will I even NOT get goosebumps at 2:00
I still can't believe that Marvel went from this to crap that that they are making today... Of course there are few exceptions but at the end of the day few movies from marvel give goosebumps to me like Infinity war, Iron man, End game used to....
still goosebumps
Darknknight was art. But lets face it....this was the greatest comic book movie of all time
I'll never forget the day I saw this trailer for the first time
I always come here to remember that feeling, that adrenaline I felt when I first saw it. I was on the train, on the way to a test, I was so hyped, all I could thing about was this teaser, I FAILED THE TEST 🤦‍♀
Also, Infinity War is way superior to Endgame... Nothing beats this movie.
5 years ago, we lost in the first MCU film I saw in theaters and second fav MCU film after Endgame (endgame was best theater experience I had)
Been 5 years but still come back just for the trailer
Any other movie or even MCU itself can not recreate that hype now.
5 Years ago, a MASTERPIECE was dropped
Stan Lee had an idea
To create a group of remarkable characters
To see if they could become something more
So when we needed them, they could fight the battles
That we never could....
Rest Well Stan Lee, you’ll hold a special place in our hearts forever
Wow aun espero la peli se ve buena
WE MISS THE AVENGERS!
April 2023, still gives goosebumps
 @mridulsachdeva391  I agree
 @mridulsachdeva391  Are you ok?
yes it has become part of our lives
 @alkumar6162  Become* Not becomes
 @bereal-dz8de  sorry typo
 @alkumar6162  what is typo?
 @bereal-dz8de  it means typing error
 @ajinjacob5092  Ok thanks
 @bereal-dz8de  when you typed something wrong
 @alkumar6162  What?
 @bereal-dz8de   such as mispelled letter and etc
 @alkumar6162  I was rectifying you , No offense
ReaperOP What is rectifying?
 @bereal-dz8de  yeah i know you were correcting me
 @ALittleToTheLeft42  u understand teach me
R.i.p black panther/Chadwick boseman.
 @mridulsachdeva391  r/ihadastroke
 @bereal-dz8de  it's that when the keyboard thinks he did a spelling error it fixes it by itself
 @bereal-dz8de  I thought u were being serious until u said 1 year old ------____-----
LUUK ? Same.
Neither me
Same. For me it was in the early morning
Same here
I didn’t think it was real
Same
Same 😭😭😭
Me too
me tricking too
Amazing
LUUK ? Me neither mate
Yes
Neither will I. So many great memories
For me, I saw it infront of Star Wars and Jumanji.
Yeah
How many people think Smash Ultimate is the true successor of the vision Stan Lee saw for the final battle?
Wasn’t just Stan lee...
 @raggens  your are a great mind
When you think about it thanos is just dumb, but admit it he is pretty badass
Legends never die
Rainbow Aleksandra Gamer 

I swear, Sakurai got inspired by the film to make all characters except kirby die.
How i miss this era
still one of the best movies in marvel history
Thor’s entrance in Wakanda was one of the most epic scenes in Marvel history
I still remember that day when this dropped. after a looooooong wait.
Till this dayy I think it's the best trailer ever made
Sometime I watch this trailer just to reminisce the good times. Miss 2018.
Coming back here to remember when Marvel movies were still actually good
I would legit pay $5K to have this movie erased from my memory to watch it again for the first time
"God, it seems like a thousand years ago. 
I fought my way out of my room, watched Iron Man...
Realized I loved the MCU."
It’s kinda sad that the golden age of the MCU is over 😢
"this does put a smile on my face" 😍
I FEEL SAD HOW PEOPLE WILL NEVER GET TO LIVE AND EXPERIENCE THIS WHOLE SAGA IN THEATRES
Best trailer of all time....period.
Remember the time I eagerly waited  to see this trailer
i know im 3 years late but... whoever made this trailer, give them a raise.
the tone, narration, music, etc ITS ALL PERFECT
If I own a movie theater someday, I shall run this movie once in a while.
Even after No Way Home release, this is still the best MCU movie.🔥🔥🔥
Watching and feeling it's hype even in 2023 now 🔥
Cap's entrance was hard💪
The MCU in its PRIME🥇🏆
Julia S Agreed! Woo!!
That was my favorite part actually I clabbed and made the whole theatre clab w me lol
Every thor scenes were amazing though 😍😍😍. But the time when he jumped and the sky turned dark with lightning everywhere was amazing
Julia S that was badass
Omg yes
Julia S Every One in the theater clapped when he did that dope ass entrance
I enjoyed the iron man suit up scene and the entrance of cap
everyone in the theater got so hyped when he entered Wakanda
Admiral Snackbar Wrong description. Thor went berserk. He went berserk as Guts the Black Swordsman when he landed in Wakanda. It was crazy but not crazy enough to have Thor gouge out Thanos’s eyeballs.
Julia S I had goosebumps & cringed when Thor made that cool entrance scene in Wakanda because the Avengers music hit then all of Avengers were happy looking at Thor coming back to help the battle 👏!
Julia S  Seriously..... that scene gave me goosebumps😍😍
Best movie scene everrrr!!! that Music was insaneee!
Julia S thor just killed it
I was crying at this scene, had teara in my eyes because i was so freaking happy 😅 Love this scene
Where I and my friend were watching (two different places), people automatically started clapping because it was so cool when he arrived
Ryatt omg
What universe their in? Like what earth did the MARVEL CINEMATIC UNIVERSE WANTED TO GO WITH?
"Fun isn't something one considers reading hundreds of comments."
"But this 😄 does put a smile on my face."
I know I said I wouldn’t watch anymore of the movies but I was really hoping to watch one last one
Ryatt me and you both
The narration is all the hero talking
The music is stan lee
The tone is script
Jacobi Leoo Dude watch the Age of Ultron trailer.... Either 1 or 2 all marvel... But yes it does suck as a movie
I’ll watch it 100 times and still get goosebumps
yeah ikr!!
its marvel what u expect
 @cage_memer  The music don't belong to stan lee, is of Alan silvestri i think. he's a legend
I mean sure the trailer is awesome but it's totally misleading! And that's a good thing, the Russos really know how to throw us off the scent
 @swedishking3222  Miss leading how?
good luck getting the rights
This Trailer still gives me goosebumps even if i already watched the movie 3 times
goosebumbs at its peak 🤩
Best marvel movie ever. Looking back, life was good. 😄
I remember when the trailer was released me and my Big brother blabbering the hole trailer's dialogue all day it was like he would say "in time " and i would say "you will know how its like to lose "🥺miss those days
Thanos collecting the stones was the best thing marvel has done and at this point today, we passed the peak
I can't wait until this movie comes out
This trailer even year after, still gives me chills :>
We all go back to this trailer knowing we're never gonna get a movie like this ever again
This trailer will never die lol
I really wish I watched this when it came out
Remember watching this for the first time at a movie theater
best marvel movie off all time
Life peaked when this released
This is Marvel. And I am really lucky that I got to experience this cinematic masterpiece 🤌🏼❤️
I still remember my voice being broken for a week after the screams I made in the theatre watching infinity war.
0:04
"There was an idea."
The idea turned into fruition & became the best idea ever...
What I wouldn't give to watch this movie with fresh eyes again
Dam I wish we could go back in time 😭
It’s really crazy how people still come by to watch this unforgettable trailer.
Over a quarter of a billion views on a trailer! That's insane.
Three times lol those are rookie numbers
 @SuperCabrito14  well I'm not gonna watch a movie 100 times its get boring
 @thorgodofthunder3181  i could rewatch it like 10 times and still not get bored of it because of how great infinity war is
I have watched it 17 times
I’ve watched it 12 times in hype of endgame
3 TIMES? PATHETIC!
I watched it over 20 times
Really I’ve seen it exactly 73 times
Thor you are literally in the Movie why are you getting goosebumps from the trailer
 @angeryangery1147  lol
Only 3 times?? Lol
Every Hero Who Died In Infinity War: You Just Wanted To See Me Die Didn’t You?
 @m4yypg3d18  bUt tHeY dIdN'T DiE, ThEy jUsT pAsSeD oUt aCcOrDiNg tO pEtEr

I watched the movie at least 40 or around 40 you’re not a true fan if you have watched the movie 3 times
I have watched it 9 times and it doesn’t get boring at all
Derpy Potato same
 @haisesasaki1461  Same
 @thorgodofthunder3181  I could honestly watch it 100 times and not get bored of it
I watched more than 10 times.
Word
Captain Marvel trailer tomorrow. Avengers 4 trailer of Wednesday or Thursday
Yes
Link Polak same.
Yup. This was my definition of anticipation. 5 years and 2 phases later, I shudder thinking what it has become and what lies ahead
Indeed
And it ended when I was born
So true

 @darshandarshan4775  who Invited my Man bud ?
Don't Insult marvel by comparing them to these cheap films
So relatable
Yes sir
Indeed
 @darshandarshan4775  i love kgf but don't compare it with infinty war . Infinity war is on another level.
'Captain Marvel' is the Worst Marvel Movie Ever..... 👍🏻. 👍🏻
It’s one of the greatest of all time
 @unknownvariable9239  the greatest*
This was the peak of MCU
0:36 bro that music gives me vibes, and tears too🥺
coming back here to feel this all over again >>>>
AHHHHHHHHH I MISS THISSSSSS
These were the days, where all we had to worry was about spoilers....
thanks marvel, i never get so hyped before
The hype and anticipation for this movie won’t ever be matched in any form of entertainment. TV show, Video game, movie, etc.
Keep coming back to this feeling !
Decades from now, all of nerd-dom will look back at this time period from November 2017 to April 2019 as the time when all nerds united to celebrate this duology.
The best trailer I've ever scene
I can't believe 4 years have passed... Man the hype was real
Realising the best trailer ever made by marvel ,👀
Never get borred ✨️
Watching the trailer again just feels like it just came out already. 🥲
2018-2019 watching Infinity War and Endgame with my father during opening days.
Everytime I watch this trailer it makes me even more sad to see what the mcu has become.
I come back here to to see Hulk at Wakanda ❤❤❤
Born too late to explore earth 
born to early to explore space
.....
born at the right time to withness this once in a generation event😍
This and man of steel trailer 2 are the best superhero movies trailers ever!! I can watch them countlessly
I love watching trailers and thinking you have no idea what’s going on. Like Thor holding the thing open for the star, u woulda never guessed he was making another weapon
Nothing beats This trailer
True. The best thing is that it was for two consecutive years (2018-2019) and in the same two months (April-June).
I still remember the day a kid at my school started screaming spoilers about the movie and the next day he was in the hospital. LOL
ummm we still worry about spoilers wym.. especially since its quarantine and the only form of entertainment is movies and social media. tf is this comment
 @blessings1063  He means we got more things to worry about now... Not that we don't have to worry about spoiler any more
i was the one doing it.
 @yashvardhansingh7149  and my comment disproves exactly that 😂 people worry about spoilers all the time doesn’t matter quarantine or not pandemic or not wtf... use common sense... tbh spoiler are even MORE of a problem NOW then they were BEFORE... because of quarantine we start watching anime and tv shows and can’t even go outside so we spend all our time on the internet where spoilers for these popular shows are everywhere wtf
 @blessings1063  Dude, can you read? He was saying that back then we ONLY had to worry about spoilers, now we have much more to worry about.
 @jackmolinacondori4711  lmfao I remember every lunch table going wild discussing it the day after it released
 @blessings1063  bro he said that back then spoilers were the only thing we had to worry about, now we have to worry about spoilers AND covid. Use Common sense
 @jackmolinacondori4711  lol
Kurapika
 @blessings1063  your name is blessings but somehow you're the one who is toxic here. How ironic.
I actually only watched the movie 2 weeks ago so I watched it only then lol
 @blessings1063  People like you make my brain sting. He said back then the ONLY thing we had to worry about was spoilers. I just want some of what you're on, sweet Jesus.
WHAT DO WE WORRY ABOUT NOW
 @neverforget6642  you are the first person in this thread to use the word toxic. Calm down, misunderstandings can happen and two other people before u explained it already u don’t have to join in when ur not required to. Ty
 @sadchild9478  ok I get it now sorry thanks
 @Darth_Vitiate  ok I get it now sorry thanks
 @blessings1063  bruh you don't have to say "toxic" to be a toxic person. The way you talk and the fact that you didn't want to acknowledge that prove my point.
 @neverforget6642  Whicht timeline from Wandavision? It was after Captain America:Civil War and they left, they lived in a house together?
True
Yeah 💔
Making me cry
soooo true 😝
That’s why you get tickets ASAP for one of the first 3 days
 @neverforget6642  its agatha all a long
Remember when someone leaked endgame and what’s going to happen it got viral marvel was begging them to delete it 😂
 @jackmolinacondori4711  
Yea(Was in 7th grade at the time). Back when Infinity War came out, most people went to see it on Thursday Night. Luckily, I stayed home on Friday to see it on Saturday without spoilers while possibly the others at school might've suffered from the spoilers. Then Endgame came by(In 8th grade) and one kid who saw it on Thursday was trying to scream out spoilers but I covered my ears on time..Finally saw it on Saturday and the IMAX theater I went to had a great audience! Time really does fly now...I miss the old years before we had much to worry about.
kurapika
 @blessings1063  the ONLY form of entertainment???? do you not draw? write? read books? sit and reflect upon yourself?
Yup
Yes
 @jackmolinacondori4711  same in my school
Now its all ji hun dies at the end of squid game
well, now we worry about no way home spoilers
I feel like the hype is going to be similar to the new Spiderman movie releasing in December
 @mariolaugh111   not this much due to covid lots of us can't go to theatres.
3 and bit just for the trailer it’s been 3 Ever from da moive
fr
Remember when y'all & some YouTuber theorized this 01:59 scene happening & when Endgame Trailer come those same people & YouTuber theorized this happen when timeheist ?

Yeah... That's why make theory as content is silly. 

I look at you New Rockstar (¬_¬)
Yes fr! Take me back 🙏🏼
 @mahuexvii  life gotten better for me ngl
Ethan Hill it was out nov 21 2017, we are almost nov 21 2021 😀
Watching Loki the series makes what happened in Infinity and Endgame insignificant almost…. If you’ve watched the series you know what I’m talking about.
dang this movie was the best I loved the infinity saga and am Exited for more.
But kgf2 is breaking
 @carolinagoldgirl8706  come out avenger comededy show, watch a real gangsta kgf2 teaser..
 @KishoreKumar-dm6rv  seriously kiddo.. comparing kgf2 to this masterpiece
Bond 007 lol true
Me to
You can, um, still explore the Earth.
 @izdatbOi  delete ur comment u just ruined it
And we ARE still exploring space
Made me smile to revisit this trailer years later and see the old comment from 17 year old me 5 years ago getting excited in anticipation for the upcoming release of the movie.
"Fun isn't something one considers when balancing the universe. But this... does put a smile on my face." has to be once of the coldest lines in the MCU to date!



Too bad it wasn't in the actual movie😂
The hype of this movie was once in a lifetime
the good old days back when marvel was still good
I can’t wait for its release
I was on hospital bed, getting ready for PUJ obstruction surgery and I watched this trailer,as doctor said I'll be on fluids and complete bed rest for few weeks. Still feels like yesterday.
"Get this man a shield."  I miss when Marvel movies were good and made you feel something good, something inspiring, and not...well, not whatever they are trying to do today.
I can't believe it was 5 years ago still feel like yesterday
Avengers 4 trailer might drop anytime and this still gives goosebumps.
pure nostalgic
Going back to watch this is like going home to a warn fireplace in winter of our discontent.
Peak mcu right here
The starting was 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
25 years later.... Still feels the same
The hype never ends
This is the best marvel movie, and probably the best superheroe movie.
I think I have watched this movie more than a hundred times since I saw it for the first time
It's 2023... The Blimp is over...
This movie makes me want to time travel back 5 years ago
🟣🔵🔴🟠🟢🟡
The BGM guys the BGM specially from the intro can easily make u feel deep serious about how the situation was in the whole movie that they are struggling for fighting to save their planet even they know they wasn't prepared for such a sudden huge threat like Thanos.
i hope they do this with kang dynasty cause for sure that movie will be hella dark and sad😢
No way home is so much hype
True
 @johnsean122  TF lol. no marvel movie is even near the hype of infinity war
 @johnsean122  infinity war is better
I remember how disappointing everyone thought the ending was though lol
only endgame and nwh can compete
 @prod.cass212  nwh and endgame both had different types of hype, as well as infinity war but yes, these marvel movies are just insane
 @Hgh38  Watched no way home it is a very good film but i think infinity war and endgame with the culmination of every hero takes it...
 @johnsean122  ok the hype was there for nwh but infinity war was a better movie
 @johnsean122  did you watch infinity war in cinema??
 @johnsean122  it's is because after watching the hype of Infinity war and endgame it attached those people who does doesn't watch marvel and then they started to watch marvel 
It's my opinion
 @johnsean122  IW is for adults, NWH is for kids.
 @normiehaitu4806  and endgame
 @prod.cass212  infinity war is the best
 @johnsean122  this had more
 @johnsean122  lmao money doesn't mean hype.   nwh was good but again nowhere near infinity war. Just once consider one thing, go seach what's the most watched trailer on YouTube, you'll get your answer on how much hype infinity war had.
 @johnsean122  NWH is good but its plotless, all this hype stuff you’re saying is your recency bias.
Also, its a completely different situation compared to 2018,
Lot of us went to the cinema for the first time in 2 years.
NWH theatre reaction doesn’t even come close to the ones in the Infinity Wars and Endgame.
 @johnsean122  doesn't matter even frozen 2 earned in billions doesn't mean it was hyped. Also avatar wasn't hyped much it still is most grossing movie. Period. The vibe around infinity war was unreal. The views on its trailer shows it.
 @johnsean122  almost everyone knew about tobey and andrew cameo from the leaks

Again, its big, but not as much as Endgame and Infinity Wars

Both of these movies had real time reactions, you can search it up as well.

Be it Thor’s entry in IW or Captain America’s Mjolnir scene from Endgame and many more such scenes…all bigger reactions than NWH.
 @fungusamongus9686  yeah,i remember too,i was so dissapointed really bad
Avatar 2 is coming
 @johnsean122  but infinite war was better I think but NWH was also amazing
Fun tuber cgi
Fun tuber Hulk was edited in the trailer ONLY because they didn't want to reveal the fact that the Hulk wouldn't be in the movie (for the most part), when Thanos bullied him. Marvel has a thing of adding/removing parts of the real movie vs the trailer version so they don't spoil anything.
Fun tuber hahaha yup, puny banner
 @johnsean122  sweet kiddo 😂
 @johnsean122  hmm maybe thats because we have a fuckig pandemic ?! there are no other movie or news or whatever to talk about of course nwh was topic #1
 @johnsean122  so? They gonna give that 2 billion or not don't be so excited for a movie sales record
 @normiehaitu4806  just wait till the next big event comes
Hrithik Srivastava black Friday or november 28th
Same
Bro forreal lol
lol ya tru tru same
1am MST over here on November 28. Still ain't nothing. Unless they roll out in the morning. Oh well. Time to go to bed and check again in the morning.
 @supercoolmunkee  Bud they probably will upload it in the afternoon if not tomorrow
Uh, it actually did. The hype is gonna return in Avengers 4.
I haven't took a shower for a year, but no it didn't we are more hyped after the ending of infinity war
Exactly
Everton D'Sousa, oh yeah!! REALLY!!
only single minded ppl said that this is a bad movie lel
Everton D'Sousa another one bites the dust 😭😭😭😭😭
When I watch the trailer I still get chills
Everton D'Sousa like 700
Rosymar Marquez, wooowww man!! Thank you guy!!. THANK EVERYONE!!
I CAN'T WAIT FOR AVENGERS 4 TRAILER!! ANYONE??
Everton D'Sousa true
Wwooowww!!! 1000 like in this comment 😲😲😲
Thank you guuuys!!!
Who’s still watching in 2021 cuz the trailer is way too epic?🔥
I would watch this again in theaters if they re-released it.
This was the peak of Marvel'.
If there was a way to turn back time and relive this I would same with Spider-Man no way home
This was a Big moment in human history
I wish we knew at that point what we were getting and unfortunately what we got afterwards
No trailer gives me the chills this did, and still does.
i feel so honored to have worked on this movie. top 3 i've ever worked on in my career.
I was in middle school when this came out now im getting ready for college holy time flies
I remember the feeling when this trailer released
The best trailer crafted in the history of movies
I see this movie in theatre but its about 4 years i come to see this trailer now ( 100 ) times....and same goosbums remeins in this❤❤
Even after watching 5 years, this trailer still effortlessly gives me goosebumps!
0:53 me everytime i re-watch this trailer
"In time, you will know what it's like to lose. To feel so desperately that you're right, yet to fail all the same."

Thanos's first words in this literally tell us that the Avengers are going to lose. Marvel trailers, man.
My daughter loves this movie.. especially thanos… I miss the old mcu
Biggest DC fan here, but this is the peak cinema we all DC fans wish we had🥲
I want to go back 😢
"Hype isnt something what i consider while watching trailers....... But this....... Does put a smile on my face"
June 25th, 2023!

Had to come back here and relive the the feeling of seeing this for the first time
Arian Karimi YES !

I wish comments were original unlike this one
Me
Best marvel trailer
Me
Thanos is terrifying in this trailer
Yep
Yes me
Oath lad
Me
Arian Karimi it’s honestly the best trailer ever
Me
bring your brave
I watched cuz I remembered hearing the AOT theme in here. I was wrong.
We
Aquaman trailer is a competitor
 @whysoserious5259  yell no
 @shogun5411  bro i knoe infinity war trailer is legendary because of history, but still aquaman trailer and and the theme song together gives gossebumps everytime and was better
Rohit Maurya no all the marvel movies  led up to this movie. Not only does the the trailer itself give you thrills but the meaning behind does and the concept of something uncontrollable as thanos is nothing compared to aquaman.
Rohit Maurya aslo it’s not even that good it’s a common action packed trailer, this is something else.
Yes not even endgame
joker trailer and avengers is #2
True
The only trailer that I can even comapre this too in terms of hype was star wars episode 7, only difference being  infinity war lives up to the hype and ep7 not so much
Days of Future Past
Facts upon facts
Logan and this
couldn’t agree more
 @whysoserious5259  No but Snyder cut trailer will be
Watch the Venom: Let There Be Carnage Trailer
How many have u worked on?
 @Ffff-fq1rh  40 movies so far. but Infinity War is in my top 3. scheduling conflict prevented me from working on Endgame unfortunately.
 @D0NTREPLY  really?
Exactly, the best avenger movie after endgame imo
Looks like you survived the snap and travelled back in time but not in the Intended timeline
 @NoName-xf9pp  no way , endgame is like 9/10 and infinity war is like 9.9/10
Yes indeed 🥂
5 years ago!!!! wtf im old
 @NoName-xf9pp  lol infinity war is better than endgame
Bruh it's still 2022 you got snapped away or something
Lol 😂
Rip Thanos. That dude is already the biggest meme in the community. 😂
I've already watch this movie lmao
Me
FreezeDontMiss Lols but then what don’t they wish to happen?
Wonder how you feeling now :/
Awesome
LoL
LOL
"Every journey has an end"
Anyone else felt like Thanos exceeded the hype given to him
The More Time Passes The More I realize ENDGAME Should've been the end.
that make goosebumps to see this trailer in 2023 (missing old marvel) 😪
You know I had to come back after secret invasions, in time 🤞🏾🤞🏾🤞🏾
I can’t believe it’s been almost 4 years since infinity war. It still is one of the most greatest movies of all time
The amount of hype that surrounded this movie will never be matched imo for a long time.
Can't believe there was an Skrull helping the Avengers fight Thanos lol
This was THE event of the year
The fact that people still watch it as we speak is awesome, marvel's greatest creation
I hope avengers: The Kang dynasty and Avengers secret war will give something has a quality like this
I could imagine after all the strikes from the writers and actors in Hollywood over, we will get good quality movies to watch in the future. And that will be worthy after all the things we have been through
This trailer literally puts smile on the face
Its still awesome❤
I was thinking about Thanos' plan and realized he could have gotten away with everything if I stead of just erasing 1/2 of the population, he rewrote reality to where 1/2 the population never existed. No one would have stopped him because no one knew anyone was gone.
Fun fact the beginning when Thanos starts talking I was thinking about Optimus Prime for a minute
Still best trailer ever
We need another avengers movie
Even after watching the movie this trailer is still great! Especially the soundtrack!
It's 2023, let's see the legends still vibing with Thanos quotes
Even after watching No Way Home

It still doesn’t feel the same after Endgame…
Happy 5 Year Anniversary To Avengers: Infinity Warefare!
The best marvel film
Best Marvel MCU but « The most greatest movies of all Time »…seriously ?
 @misterjeyslik1879  yes
 @slothman7693  Having said that, if you haven't seen a lot of movies, I can understand.
You might not be interested in cinema as a whole, but only superhero movies
 @misterjeyslik1879  nah its fr
Lmao greatest movie of all time? Wtf are you tripping on son?
 @misterjeyslik1879  Or, I know this may be a hard concept to grasp based on your comments, but maybe it’s his personal opinion?
 @elijahthomas3644  and i disagree... thats how opinions work son
Not almost. It is
 @chriswyatt9869  Bro can you read 😂? He said one of the greatest
 @chriswyatt9869  Can you read English ?
Oiiiii
 @misterjeyslik1879  "ONE" of the most.
reading comprehension dude 😂
 @chriswyatt9869  he said "One of the most"😂
you tripping brother hahaha reading comprehension left the earth haha
 @DougieYT  he lacks of common sense dude hahaha. or a bitter *ceu fan haha
 @kaizenrogers806  LOL maybe
 @kaizenrogers806  yikes imagine still debating marvel vs dc in 2022🤣 Marvel and DC are friendly rivals but the fans don't realize that
Shakit Solanki thanos😂?
Shakit Solanki I love it all, but finally seeing the Guardians of the Galaxy crew finally on the same screen. 😳😳😳😳
For real. Same here
Vision dying puts a smile on your face
Dc is best
T' Challa: "Evacuate the city, . . . . engage all defenses, . . . . and get this man a shit."
Tell me how u feel now
True
the soundtrack is awesome
You are absolutely right :-D
Ikr
Adam Manneh ikr
Adam Manneh seriously the soundtrack is awesome
The greatest movie of all time❤
in the age of wokeness, Thanos was right
Aww, I miss the hype leading up to this film, all the talk in school and going to the cinema and watching it was truly amazing
This was the saddest trailer of all time😭😭
Endgame was emotion
But infinity war was masterpiece💖
In simple ...best trailer ever
It's been more than 4 years and i still can't believe of how marvel fooled us byfalsely showing hulk fighting in wakandan battle.
Whenever my Grandchildren come to me for a story it will start by the words, " There was an idea...."
Infinity war: mr stark I don’t feel so good

Endgame: we did it mr stark we won
This is when the two year hype began
For me Thanos is not a villian.... "finally someone consider to balance this universe".... Kudos to him
God we peaked and crashed so hard after the Infiniti saga…rip mcu 😢
Still fire 😭
It's actually time for the Endgame now(five years from the Thanos' snap). 😮
10 YEARS in the wait for this moment
Best trailer period
Man it's just so amazing that people still keep coming back to this

I guess no one moved on after all...
That will forever be the quote for thanos !! :45- - Destiny has Arrived
good old marvel days
Stan Lee. After you passed on, marvel went with you.😔
A masterpiece
The G.O.A.T
Same here :(
I remember I saw Cap’s phone number and wanted to take a picture and actually call it lol
Omg yes :(
Yeah, I miss that too. I saw the movie opening weekend with my buddies, and all we could say for the whole ride home after seeing it was "what?"
Same :( I’m sad because the avengers are done and I don’t think I’ll ever get the hype for this movie and the hype for endgame back :(
Literally same
SaME!
Dude you're awesome
Zara Smith your awesome
bot.
What?
Zara Smith spoilers is what he said. He won
No me quiero ir sr stark :'v

Infinity war: I don't wanna go, Mr Stark


Endgame: Please don't go, Mr Stark
Dominic Viera 😭
Fans: You took everything from us!!
Marvel: i don't even know who you are
Its ok you can rest now 😫
Sorry, Tony 😭
“Mr. Parker, I don’t feel so good”
Penny Williams and that’s my fault
Penny Williams lol why read the comments then🤣
 @dominicviera2317  would have been better if you said Uno Reverse.

You’re not awesome, that’s just copyright. 🤜🏻©️

💯
 @dhung020  I don’t remember if it was good because I was a kid when I watched this but I think it was good
 @dhung020  It was good indeed
You watching KGF CHAPTER 2 TRAILER
'Captain Marvel' is the Worst Marvel Movie Ever.... 👍🏻. 👍🏻. 👍🏻. 👍🏻
 @dhung020  Was it?
I've been watching Marvel since childhood
Do y’all remember the morning this trailer dropped those were the days
Com certeza a luta em Wakanda seria muito melhor se fosse com o Hulk no nível máximo de raiva .
já se fazem 5 amo 😢
They should make more thanos like villains who hates heroes ❤  Nowadays fans like villains more than heroes
Guys I have to say this
THIS IS LITERALLY THE BEST MOVIE IN THE WHOLE MCU
It can even top endgame
Golden days😭
This truly was an incredible film. And Even if some of the individual films building up to it weren't the greatest, they were important pieces to the puzzle. Thanos was executed so well, a villain that no matter how much you disagreed with him, some part of you still understood his perspective. Everyone giving everything they can to defeat him, all end with failure. The entire movie is a roller coaster,  up, down and all around. At the end of it? So many people left feeling utterly shocked, and to some, completely defeated.
Whenever I find MCU to be real bad these days, I come watch this trailer, just to take me back to the good old times. Corporates kill anything thats functioning well. Be it food chains like KFC or Comics based movies.
Till this day this trailer gives me chillz
I have watched movies in my time but this one I gat give to the history books of one the best movies of all times
It's been 5 years since THE BLIP. And it seems MCU should just go back in time to the same spot once again, and learn from their own marvellous movies to make something better this time.
Any one today remember this legendary movie.
This is the only trailer which can still get new comments every day after 2 years
The trailer was released for as long as The Blip lasted, oh how time flies am I right?
Joder esto si es cine
Anybody here in 2023 who suddenly remember this legendary movie ❤
Esto si me emocionó cuando salió xdddd
every thing marvel studios have worked for, have led to this.
5 years.... feels like it was yesterday!
I said it before and I'll say it again, I know they are own by different production companies but they should have all got together and have the x-men and the Fantastic Four in this also. Can you see the Thing yellin "ITS CLOBBERIN TIME" and the Hulk be envious finally come out and help and Wolverine come out and have fun slicin and dicin , Storm stiking would have been sweet.
Yes it was crazy
A fuckin men
such good days,everything was good,we were all innocent and happy until-
Everyone i knew was talking about it, the teachers were watching it in class, people didn't care about anything else. I've never seen that much hype.
It was 5am in the morning!
In Indonesia this trailer was came out at night
I couldnt stop crying
I was entering school and freaked out when I saw the Endgame trailer drop!
It felt like Christmas morning :,)
Yes I remember Haha I was at school so much nostalgia
 @samarthh6401  same dude
It was 1st period freshman year and we was wack
who zhe hell
ikr same with the endgame trailer every one at school was freakin tf out
megaman bombfire I literally liked your comment so you could be at 666 🤟🏽
Like it was yesterday, Sebastian Stan was on GMA
I'll never forget tuning in to GMA and seeing Sebastian Stan help reveal the trailer.
Its evening 6.30 in india.
Good times. Good fuckin' times.
good old timess
Real sad boi hours over here
I skipped school for the trailer
Yahhh ..... that morning 😙🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
megaman bombfire yes
I remember the morning endgame trailer dropped but sadly not the day this one dropped and in my opinion this is better than endgame
Those were the day
Yeah. I remember when I got outta school and saw this in my recommended lol. I flipped out man...
I was in school...I got back..the first thing i do was to watch this...i cried after that
Dropped on my birthday!
When the trailer dropped I was taking a crap and when endgame dropped I taking another crap coincidence I think not!!
I never felt more alive than that day
Yeah it’s so crazy too because now we know what happens in this movie and endgame
no.
idk why does it feel like it was 20 years ago
hell yeah
People were watching it at my school in class 😂
They don't make trailers like they used to. Lol. You sound like a old man talking about when he was a kid.
Everyone was talking about it in my school even the principal announce it.  Cool days.
For me it was 7pm in India
I was on a 14hr flight so I didn’t even know til we landed
You made me cry
Until corona virus dropped
Stayed home from school just to watch the trailer, worth it for the hype!
I remembered I saw the notification on my phone then I turned it on my big TV before getting ready for school. Good old daysz
megaman bombfire  it was amazing!
Yeah, I miss the hype =(
this trailer legit like broke the internet
Ahh pre covid are movie going ☺
ofc i remember lmao so much fkn hype
 @MrGoldMan  this trailer is awesome tf you talking about
 @MrGoldMan  what do you mean
 @MrGoldMan  why
For me it was the afternoon
Even to this day I still remember waking up to the first and second trailer, heck I even remember reacting to the leaked footage 

The hype was definitely up there before and when the movie came out
I remember being at working and getting the notification and going to the bathroom to watch it lol
Ye
12 year old me seeing the trailer attached to The Last Jedi and Jumanji is still silently saying "Hell...Yeah.."
Fr I remember waking up getting ready for school and then I saw my mom watching the trailer on the news
That was awesome. Almost everyone I knew was talking about it
Endgame looks weak compared to this.
And that feeling for defeat is what made this movie so relatable... We all felt the L when the snap happened.
 @Mvmajor3m  facts. We took that L home with us man
Hello
 @kimberlyalice8619  sup?
 @dangiampietro6606  good and you

💪🏿👍🏽🙏🏽💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿
Kip Congure yup

Ever heard of rick Astley

 @alannafratello5167  yes
Years?
So true
Yeah
Just wait for endgame
No baby u r wrong
Nah. The new warriors with snowflake and safespace will beat it. People will talk trash about it for years to come.
Because this is the most popular video in this channel.
Kip Congure true
Still my favorite
true
Yeah I can never forget the end game
Tbh every video every video on YT can get comments through time
absolutely
Yep
fr
we should expect the trailer for Avengers 4 to drop any day now.
Fr... i remember the first thing i did when i woke up that day is grab my phone and go to youtube lol
I KNOW RIGHT
Lol I put the same comment and it only got 6 likes wtf
 @sethdraven4533  RIP xD

Ernesto Herrera same

Nice profilepic
Ernesto Herrera 2 years now







Feels like yesterday
That s right:)
God it seems like a 1000 years ago, the Avengers went up against Thanos and lost
Did you noticed that end of every mcu movies it is written that thanos will arrive, avengers will return etc but this time it was not written.
The walking dead fan like me, I like it!
Ernesto Herrera true
I AM GROOT
 @groot1474  I am Steve Rogers
 @groot1474  I am Steve Rogers
 @hxmbling4363  
I am groot
It feels like yesterday because you saw the movie on Netflix yesterday I know I did
 @jasonred9560  
I AM GROOT
Your right man!
yaaa
So true
Not gonna lie. Sometimes I wish it all started tomorrow so we could live through it all again for the first time.
Same , feels i have just had tuition and went to the cinema with my dad yesterday
Yeah
Honestly ur Right 
The hype feels like yesterday
You are in quantum realm
@Ernesto Herrera 1 and a half for me.
I have watched infinity war 10 times but still watching trailer and feeling sorry for Hulk 😅😅
AWSOME!!!
Top 10 movies ever made. A whole era of different story lines wrapped into a mammoth conclusion. Only other notable film that’s top 10 during my lifetime is the dark knight with the joker. These are two movies we won’t see again. Impeccable.
Anyone here on 2023.. still gets goosebumps while watching this trailer
Steve Rogers: The glass is half full.
Tony Stark: The glass is half empty.





Thanos: The glass is perfect.
El mejor tráiler
I miss these marvel years before they went full disney
Endgame got a Shot only because of this Master Piece!!!
Imagune about time when will the secret war trailer will drop😮❤
It's tradition to watch this every now and then. Some people stop, but not us.
The end of this trailer had to be rewatched in preparation for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3.
Now it’s all gone down the drain😢 (it actually hurts to know what Disney did to this beautiful universe)
Thor entering Wakanda is the best scene in MCU, fight me
for me , its the best trailer and best movie in marvel history
It's a movie that goes against my common sense that heroes always win.
What a fantastic movie. Cannot wait for Avengers 4, next year.
I was eagerly waiting for hulk in theatre 😢 but this trailer deceived me.
Trailer still bangs
After five years 😍😍😍😍
NO MOVIE IN THE MCU WILL EVER EVER EVER BEAT WATCHING INFINITY WAR FOR THE FIRST TIME.
Endgame was great but nowhere near top 10.  This though.
Steve Rogers: The glass is half full.
Tony Stark: The glass is half empty.







CIVIL WAR 2
Is all things should be.
Joday Jokes drax: the glass is gamora
Of the glass is Drax.
Drax: Why is glass?
Thanos perfectly balanced
There ain't a glass no more.
Drax: Why is the glass
Glass: I m glass
*balanced
The glass is perfectly balanced, half full/half empty as it should be
Joday Jokes nick fury the glass is mine.
Tonny Stark: The size of the glass is twice that we need it.
I m glass son of bottle
or the glass is being rape- fe...
Not us
Indeed
some people move on, but not us.
Not us
Not us ✊🏾✊🏾
Not us.
Not us united
Kerrod Nolan holly crap??!!!  What!!   My childhood is alive???
Kerrod Nolan yep
Kerrod Nolan same
Kerrod Nolan Criss on the infinity earth  throw  the infinity war in future
MuhibTheGamer777 Awesome sure...
Half a year later
Endgame is coming
Yep that opening scene is the best opening scene to a superhero movie ever, and i watched the dark knight several times
2018: This is such a good Trailer
2099: This is such a good Trailer
Yes you’ve comeback to the greatest trailer ever
Memories bring back.....😢
This movie alone is better than the entire phase 4, even nwh.
5 years later YouTube recommend me this trailer. 😮
Coming back to this trailer, it’s sad to see how far Marcel have fallen in the last 5 years
amazing movie!
..
:face-red-heart-shape::face-red-heart-shape:
Thor was hands down the best character.
Especially the scene where he entered Wakanda. I lost my sh*t
My theater went crazy over that.
For us Transformers fans, this was "Dark of the Moon" for us!!
A small price to pay for salvation. ..I'm the only one who knows that. At least, I'm the only one with the will to act on it... Still remember all these dialogue .. What a movie 😅
I've been watching Marvel since childhood
The background music reminds me of the good old days of 2018. 😌
I am watching the video on mute and I'm already getting goosebumps
You cannot live with the ending of the movie........where did that bring you


Back to the trailers.
We still waiting for that money shot. The final charge lead by The Captain
Great memories man
GREATEST. MOVIE. EVER.
Ngl I am never gonna get bored of watching this trailer
Thanos will be forever super villain.....
This movie is our generation's empire strikes back.
Spider no way home?
​ @sgandfriendsstudio2320  Are you serious? Can't even get close to it. Avengers Infinity War best trailer ever
Yeah whatever you say
KGF chapter 2
 @jackthemagician9058   comparing kgf to this masterpiece seriously??
 @jackthemagician9058  trailer is not released yet!!
correct
Gvk's Trailer had more Hype.
 @sgandfriendsstudio2320  I don't think the no way home trailer is better but it has more hype because of the nostalgia it gives otherwise it was an okay trailer.
In my opinion, The Batman is the best trailer but this is definitely one of the most epic.
 @jackthemagician9058  what the?
Me too
 @divineraccoon1276  no this was the greatest trailer and movie ever
I personally think Logan, El Camino, The Batman, X-men Days of Future Past, and The Social Network had better trailers
Yes
 @takonadareishvili1743  nah
 @takonadareishvili1743  no the hype for this was unreal
 @takonadareishvili1743  yeah because of this trailer 😂
 @jackthemagician9058  🤣
KFG 2, an indian film !! Just crossed 270M views!
That's the highest in the whole world
 @jackthemagician9058  you've introduce me to a masterpiece. thank you!
You have good taste.
 @takonadareishvili1743  I agree the force awakens was a really good trailer, same with the first rogue one trailer imo
 @OguzKarabicakk  This wasn't even an accurate trailer. How could it be the best ever?
Yesssssss
Nah, any trailer of any Tarantino or Nolan movie is better than this. And for all those asking, I‘m here because I searched for the Infinite Warfare trailer to look how many dislikes they have…
 @OguzKarabicakk  he’s taking numbers not the quality it’s beat it that way
 @sgandfriendsstudio2320  no
Godzilla kotm?
Nah endgame was better
 @sgandfriendsstudio2320  hell no
nwh trailer 2
 @sgandfriendsstudio2320  nah this is better
yeah i watch this often
Age of Ultron trailer 3 is the best this is bogus in front of that !!!
 @sgandfriendsstudio2320  lmao isn’t even half as good as this even with goblin or doc in it
eternals trailer
 @nylekamran9659  nothing comparable
 @sgandfriendsstudio2320  it was most viewed trailer not the best ☠️
Mi6
 @jackthemagician9058  wtf
 @_arnavmathur  yes wtf 😎
Chief Ed. "I told you, you will die for that" as goosebumps as it gets
Also the "If I don't win, what else can I lose?" Man...Thor lost his planet, his people, his brother, his advisor....Why MCU hates Thor?
Chief Ed Yp same
Yeah,that part where Thor landed in Wakanda I was like “HOLY CRAP ! THIS IS EPIC !”.
Especially Doctor Strange
Player Zero I think marvel just wants to make him more epic
it was thors fault everyone died.
mine too!
Same! I just love Thor he is awesome! :D
i totally agree...tor was far way te best... i loved im in tis movie <3
People clapped in the theater I went when Thor arrived.
Yesss
Yes
Chief Ed I’ve watched the movie 3 times already and every single time people went crazy on that scene.
Max No it was Chris Pratt's fault. They almost had the guantlet off.
That part was so cool! Best part of the whole movie
Mine too
no it was quills fault
He was best character from the start of the MCU but ok
Meet my friends, rabbit and tree.
Chief Ed sameee
Max lmao not like anyone could have a chance
Chief Ed lel
Chief Ed Spiderman is just as dead as the avengers future movies
Max it was starlords
lol
So tru
😂😂
Get outta my head
So right omg

Thanos is dat you?
One of the best comments ever!!!
Much happier places
You can't either pal
Yesssss
Who is after Saaho trailer
GET OUT OF MY MIND!!!  NEVAAAR!!!  HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!
Russo brothers: we thought after we eliminated half the characters and told you that they're dead for good, everyone would move on, but you've shown us that's impossible. As long as there are those that remember what was, there are those that are unable to accept what has been, they will resist.
Subha datla so original
Subha datla Back to a person who copys comments.
Shawn Grainger it’s copied..
Elijah Shinn It’s copied tho, He took it from endgame trailer.

Stealing comments from Endgame trailer
Congratulations, You're now the next Thanos
How
Tru
LMFAO THIS COMMENT DESERVES A MILLION LIKS
boaaa
it's me
Lol
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Same!!!!!
I think it's actually endgame. Coz
"I am your father"
"I am inevitable"
The villains' lines
 @yakinyamaddi2562  pretty sure he means it in a way where the heroes loose.
 @jxlotus5606  ohh
 @yakinyamaddi2562  you really had to have that spelled out for you? 😂
 @owlcircus6811  ???
 @yakinyamaddi2562  I mean I thought it was obvious he meant empire strikes back because of their common themes of heroes losing the battle  but you just saw the loose connection between two lines saying “I am” instead of what the actual depth
 @owlcircus6811  I know that😑🙄🙄🤦‍♀️
With the difference that Empire Strikes Back actually is a good movie and entertains
 @doncorleole2356  wow man careful with that edge
Rusty Gecko In 10 years you will regret ever having said that
 @dumdum93  funny how you called out one guy for trying to be too edgy and the comment below yours is even edgier
 @yakinyamaddi2562  nah, endgame is more of the Return Of The Jedi of this generation.
This makes me really sad. They got empire strikes back and we got this garbage😞
 @owlcircus6811  I thought he meant in the sense that it's an epic story of an epic franchise. But that's a better explanation lmao.
 @doncorleole2356  Ehmm, your not ready. Your head is broken! You might wanna see a doctor
 @Sylvan.K  You’ll regret saying that. Wait ti’ll Star Wars is gonna done. Marvel’s universe is expanding we got shang chi, mrs marvel, young avengers (coming in the future),
AND MORE!
true
2 insecure star wars fans are hating on this comment. They just proving how toxic the Star Wars fanbase is
This makes me feel involved and part of something,this Valentine’s Day I’m pathetic and alone thank you for making the pain go away for a moment
 @doncorleole2356  he's probably a kid lol
 @bsl4762  You think he'll grow one day?
Im glad i get to be here when it happened
 @doncorleole2356  Depends , if he leaves the Disney Park then maybe 🤷🏿‍♂️😂
 @lukeskywalker144  If you included me I gotta disappoint you, I'm actually not that big of a Star Wars fan. I'm much more of a fan of the art form film, and all I said is that 95% of Marvel movies are objectively bad, most of them function in the same no risk entertainment cash-grab formula
​ @bsl4762  😂
I wouldn't go THAT far, but yes it is good
Endgame was better idk (just my opinion)
ew.
I JUST WATCHED THIS MOVIE IN 2019
But it’s better than empire strikes back
 @kronoskaalan1838  I agree with you but I can see why people may think that Infinity War's better (some people think that Endgame's too slow and boring unlike Infinity War). Tbh the best way is to watch Infinity War and Endgame together as a nearly 6 hour long film, that's the best experience.
I agree but Revenge of the Sith is more like this
Combine both infinity war and endgame and thats our empire strikes back
 @doncorleole2356  bro if you hated infinity war then why are you even here?
 @lukeskywalker144  dude star wars is still expanding
no
As someone who lived through both you are extremely lucky to have been a kid and saw this live in theaters for the first time.
 @yakinyamaddi2562  endgame was worse
 @lukeskywalker144  marvel is cliche and predictable. No emotional weight
 @cloutxart3010  Yeah, but marvel is expanding more. Look at marvel disney investor’s day. We got a lot of catch up with the comics
 @yourcousin.probably.840  Cry about it
 @therunn3197  because people love to hate
 @kakacarrotcake392  Especially now with the pandemic, I swear i’ve seen more hate comments during quarantine than I have in all my other years on the internet
Mine was The Return of the King...But I enjoyed the infinity saga too.
 @yakinyamaddi2562  Cliff-hanger suspense over the year, simular to  ESB
 @doncorleole2356  boomer alert
Back in the good old days not a single actor had legal troubles in their pesonal life and so each and every one of them were able to be in the movie and none of them were cancelled.
Infinity war is by far the best marvel movie. It's a shame that the writers were morons and wrote themselves into a hole for endgame and killed off infinity war thanos early in the film . Ultimately, endgames biggest hero was the random rat who brought back antman. Introducing thanos was masterful and poetic, but they just didn't have the brain cells to write a good story on how he'd be beaten
Crazy how they put hulk in that wakanda scene to not give any spoilers
Still the biggest eargasm ever at 2:03
Maturity is when u realize Thanos was right...
remembering when this first came out.. when we all didn't know what was ahead of us.
Marvel when things were serious
Missing old days 😢😔
Happy 5th birthday, Infinity War!
The re watchablity of Infinity war is better than Endgame
POV: It's 2017 and you're running around your room from excitement
Can’t believe how old this movie is already. Fixing to be 3 years old
One day you'll read this comment. You'll come here to watch this trailer hearing from your elders about the movie. But you'll never understand the feeling of it. It was our childhood,, it was the talks of the recess time in our school colleges,, it was the dream that we had during night,, it was the escape from reality for a whole decade for us. It wasn't just a movie,, hours and hours would pass between friends groups discussing just useless things of the movies of this decade,,it was our whole fantasy world that we lived for a whole phase of our lives.

I wish the same for u fella. May your generation have something exactly just like this,, something to dream of,, something to crave for.
Kahit 5 years na.. Di parun Kukupas ang trailer na to.🔥🔥
259m views? I swear this will reach 300m oneday.
Its 2023 ,5 years since infinty war and yet marvel has'nt produced anything near to it.Absolute marvelous.
Thanks to Russo brothers.
This was peak mcu. Everything went downhill after endgame.
It’s been exactly 3 years since this movie dropped and yesterday it was also 2 years since Avengers Endgame was released. Man, I miss the good times...
This was MCU at its best!
They blew all the budget on this movie, even from the movies the past 4 years.
Man we had an emotional rollercoaster ahead of us
Infinity war ages like fine wine but endgame while still amazing is aging like milk except the third act
Yeah man, time flies fast
i remember the day of first speculations and gossips about that movie, good times
Bro I remember counting the days till this movie came out
It doesn't feels real but here we are
fixing? tf?
 @cashcarti8100  lol Same I was counting too
Ikr. But I bet after 5 years and so itll be the most remarkable MCU movie (both A:Infinity War & A:Endgame)
I'm just waiting for Galactus now to be confirmed for the mcu
 @dwightschrute832 Here we are now lol
Haha so true. I grew up watching Marvel since like Iron man 2 or 3.
Kids in the future will have to watch the 2,000 movies of marvel to catch up XD 😂
emzzzz
Greatest marvel movie for me
Guardians vol 3 is the closest but still far.
2017-2019 was a good era
 @idontknowwhattoputformyuse1104  i would give ANYTHING to go back
 @idontknowwhattoputformyuse1104 for mine 2013-2018
already 2 years for endgame!? man that went by fast as heck
It’s so sad to know it’s just going to be garbage from here on in, saying goodbye to treasured characters to make way for awful ones.
2014 - 2019 golden era
 @andyz2861  But we cant judge the potential of The Eternals ,it might be a good movie,who knows
 @andyz2861  every good things must end
2000-2012 golden era 2013-2019 the best era
😭😭😭
You ARE IN the good times. Appreciate it. Always.
2016-2019 was the peak of MCU movies to be honest.
 @Infinite-void908  Absolutely agree!!!
Cinema has never been the same since this
Best Marvel's movie EVER
I love marvel ❤
Came here after watching endgame amazing movie
goosebumps
Background sound is what makes this movies more impactful
I came back to cry
The hype was real❤
Idc how corrupt or evil Disney gets I get marvel movies like this ever 10 years I’m a happy guy
This trailer is breaking all the records 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Although for almost everyone, Endgame is the best, for me Infinity War is the best because this movie showed us something different from what we were used to, but above all, we saw Cap America with a beard🤭
Those days were good..
5 years ago, most excited event happens...
Funny that when they show the Guardians of the galaxy you can barely see Drax 😂😂😂
5 years later. Endgame should came out this year
Still the best movie trailer ever made. Sent the world on a frenzy the day this was released
I am witnessed this masterpiece in theater 🎥 😍 💜 ❤️ ✨️ 🙌 🎥 😍 💜 ❤️ ✨️ 🙌 🎥 😍 💜 ❤️ ✨️ 🙌
One of the Best BGM in Marvel Universe.
For me it's still make's me cry, I like Infinity War, more than Endgame
this is the best trailer I have ever seen
michael edwards Same
Yep
same :) :D
I still remember when this trailer first came out and I was super hyped and wondering how this would end. Thank you Marvel for such an amazing journey :')
 @MinecraftPro239  idk but was endgame the last avenger movie?? was it confirmed well there might be an avenger movie in phase 4 too idk.
i watched the movie and its so full of emotions:') full of tense, goosebumps, happiness, sadness. and some of the scene that made me laugh out loud. its all mixed emotions. has me crying twice. n also everyone clapped throughout the movie bc how awesome it was, it's amazing.
Professor Meowingtons don’t worry they will make more in the future :)☀️
Part of the journey is the end. The original avengers will not return.
What is the name of music
Same
zain Blazingking Yes Endgame is the final Avengers movie.
michael edwards loved it 3000
Endgame was terrible
Same
I wouldn't call it amazing! It's definitely a good film, and I've seen it 4 times now so I've had time to digest everything.
I think it was a very clunky film, but I'll disagree with anyone who says it's trash!
michael edwards to think this movie only played with your emotions a fraction of the way endgame did
"You went to watch endgame uh, where did that bring you, back to me" - infinity war
Masterpiece
Same bro
 @MattSmith-vl8zp  u have a bad taste in movies lol
Are there Any cool fighting scenes in endgame like there were in infinity war ...if yes then only i will go to watch it
 @zalfasyahira1946  no I like movies that dont have huge plot holes.
Tony...
AVENGERS!! 




assemble...
I'll watch end game friday! Wish me luck!!!
Facts
I came back to check when the next avengers trailer will come out
This will make 100m views
Farhan Mehmood tiger zindai hai got 1m likes bruh
Farhan Mehmood what? !?
Diane A. Bauer Spoil it for me!
For me it's both equal I will feel empty if I only watch infinity or endgame only😅
I agree.

I went to a bar the night this was released.

A random couple next to us were watching and discussing it! Never had seen something like that before.

Easily the most hyped trailer ever.
I would argue episode 7 of Star Wars did the same thing if not better. If we're talking solely about trailers and not the actual movie.
R S I agree. Some scenes in the movie wasn’t done as good as in the trailer. Most notably the part where T’Challa tells his people to get Cap his shield. That’s why I said this trailer is the best of all time
Liar
 @danielmensah3746  what trailer is better?
 @aldyrasyid  Godzilla king of the monsters is better
 @danielmensah3746  in terms of special effects?
 @SimonPetrikov12  Nah. You just look at the view count across different platform, let alone this specific video.

Infinity War is by far the most watched trailer ever.
Dark knight 😎
This is great and a way better movie but watch the Age of Ultron Teaser... Fire... the Movie? Straight trash
Nah nowhere near
 @thecalamity278  what trailer is better
 @aldyrasyid  loads are better, can't name them all. This trailers not THAT good tho
 @thecalamity278  just name one off the top of your head, the one that's definitively better than this. I'm curious
 @aldyrasyid  any of the Joker trailers easily
 @thecalamity278  OHHH you mean cinematography-wise? Gotta agree there. Infinity War is not an Oscar-type movie visually, tho. It's just the most long-awaited movie of the decade 😂
 @aldyrasyid  no I don't mean the movie I'm talking about the trailers
 @thecalamity278  yeah, the Joker trailers are much better then these visually. When you remember the context and the day the trailer dropped, this one beats the rest. Hard to accept that if you already feel some type of way about the movies tho. Marvel's not everyone's cup of tea 😂
 @aldyrasyid  I don't mind marvel movies but visuals aside, the Joker trailer is much better
 @thecalamity278  you "don't mind" implies you're not a huge fan either. Probably you weren't among the 244M humans that went crazy for this trailer as well. But you definitely checked it out years after it was released tho lmao
 @aldyrasyid  or you're just being ignorant and are trying to make my point irrelevant🤓

I don't have 30 posters of the avengers on my wall

Not to mention,if I don't like Marvel then my opinion on whether or not this is a good trailer is more valuable since I'm not already hyped for it, nice going tho
 @aldyrasyid  visually, I think the Snyder Cut wins. Zack may or may not be good at stories depending on your tastes, but visuals are one thing he has always had down.
 @thecalamity278  I’m happy that even the haters of this movie are still watching the trailer 3 years after it was released. Even I don’t watch the Joker trailers like you watch Avengers loool
 @thegoliath9310  bruh the justice league ain't even close to this . I wouldn't even put in the top 10 superhero movie trailers of all time
 @kwesietsibah2917  2017 JL definitely not. But Snyder Cut trailer is awesome.
 @thegoliath9310  still not touching this trailer tho. This trailer is top 3
 @kwesietsibah2917  definitely. But ZSJL is easy top 10. I mean... Considering what happened a few years ago, the amount of hype it's getting is spectacular. It could very well mean the beginning of a good DCEU. You must realize that, with DC's resources and iconic characters, all it needs is momentum and it really won't take long to compete with and beat Marvel. Marvel only started getting more popular around 2008, with Iron Man. And it took them till, like mid Phase 2 to start beating DC. With DC's iconic characters and simple nostalgia, DC can very easily beat Marvel. They just needs some better writers.
 @thegoliath9310  also we are talking about trailers. This isn't starting nothing. Because the dceu is done. They already making a trilogy with another batman. They've already made a different joker film to the Jared Leto.  And wonder woman 1984 wasnt very good . So it's not starting anything anytime soon.
 @thegoliath9310  the hype is basically comparable to loki and that's a tv series 😂
 @kwesietsibah2917  DC beat Marvel for decades. They can do it again. I am not saying they will, or that it will be soon. I am not saying Avengers is at all bad. (It pretty much is cgi and jokes at this point but I digress.) I am saying that DC is not as down as you think.
 @thegoliath9310  also marvel was basically beating dc at the end of phase one. Avengers grossed more than all the dark knight films. So realistically they already ahead. They have been basically been ahead for about 9 years .
 @kwesietsibah2917  several decades > 9 years.
 @thegoliath9310  cgi and jokes? I dont know if u have been keeping up 😂. Coz wandavision is very serious.  Isnt that what dc is as well. I mean the whole batman vs superman film was a joke in itself.  They are basically down as I think. Iconic characters dont save u from years of mistakes.  A good structure does. And kevin feige has the best structure.  A structure that dc tried to copy and embarrassed themselves in the process
Anyone else revisiting after 5 years?
This movie promised, this movie delivered
I watched this trailer more time then movie, i remember every dialogue of this trailer.
Who is here in 2023?
Still memorising this Cinematic Experience 💥✨
I was 33 when I first saw this trailer.. now im 38...  will be back here when im 43...
Can’t believe today marks five years of this master piece!  I have so many amazing memories from watching this in theatres
Everyone here compare End Game and Infinity War and here i am see these two as one  5 Hours 30 minutes movie.
The hype this trailer gave the entire comic book fandom has never been seen before or since. This is by far the greatest trailer in movie history.
Good memories of what was,....before Disney destroyed it with "phase 4".
Here's hope to the annihilation of ESG, the people behind it, and anything that would try to take it's place.
I saw this in the theaters it was epic 😮
I want to erase my memory and watch this for the first time
When Nick says "there was an idea" all I can think of is MLK's "I have a dream"
The best trailer
Goosebumps even after release....in 2023 after 5 freakin years and still the same feel from trailer
Недавно с Зубаревым пересмотрел весь Марвел кайф 🤤
Anyone else still pissed about them teasing us with the hulk at the end?
1:59 wait a sec 
Am I seeing hulk in this scene 🤯🤯
But not in the movie ..........wtf
The 20 year anniversary re-screenings can’t* come soon enough for me
5years done now  time to go watch endgame 😅
You couldn't watch any MCU movie in last 1 year. And where did that bring you?


Back to the Trailers.
Indeed it did
Delivered more that promise
that's the amazing part, marvel truly goes beyond every time
Indeed it lived up to the hype!
Thats true but The Iron man 3 trailer had me hype but the movie twist was a let down.
Wait so the ending with hulk...is that in the next movie because he didnt fight in the war
Soulo Dolo misdirection. It's obviously NOT in the next one. It was a FAKE scene to keep the movie from being too predictable. The Russos said that. In Avengers 4 there are gonna be other fight scenes, not Wakanda again.
i guess but hulk never appeared in the battle scene
Nevin Rhymer exactly, I did not like how they portrayed Ben Kingsley as the Mandarin: a drunken, alcoholic, womanizing actor fronting 4 the real Mandarin played by Guy Pearce smh
This is the only movie i can think of in the last 10 years that lived up to the insane hype and even surpassed it
Yes man, did it deliver!
666th like
Gaydian lenny thanks lol
The only thing that disappointed me was the lack of Hulk
Joshua V. Harding and vision, dude was a liability the whole movie😂
Soulo Dolo no they did that to throw us off. Same as the amount of infinity gems Thanos had when he was fighting on Titan. Genuis on Disney's part or the directors. I expect them to do the same for Avengers 4.😉
Agreed!!
Except Hulk
ComicBook Guy way better crossover than justice league movie not cartoon
ComicBook Guy well it could've  been a wee bit better but it was amazing
Musawir Mehfuz yes
Aaron CJ He was in it. He just got owned. 😂
Russo knows there shit.
Wankd for ever😘😚😙😗😜😛😍☺😅😅😅😂 I love💘 this 
Movie😻😻😻😻😻😻
,,,,, what kind of food what kind of forever
Unlike the DC movie universe.
Isaac Escobar no cause thanos scared the shit out of him. I guess we have to wait until another hulk movie to see how he can take away the fear!
Joshua V. Harding well when u got a big dude like thanos with gem stones the balance is tipped for now!
Joshua Eden true vision had a little power but you sometimes can't stop fate and thanos brought it!
Aaron CJ true sometimes fear gets the best of us even the hulk!
Yeah unlike other movies. Ahem star wars ep8, justice league
And it doesn’t
Nope
Since thor was never in wakanda
The best movie since LOTR.
Unless you are a hulk fan lol, plus no one uses the gems except thanos anyway
Not hulk tho
Chandros Evans the Mandarin was never shown on screen, but mentioned in an extra scene with Ben Kingsley in prison
Only thing I didn’t like is I would’ve liked to see the hulk
There was a great Hulk fight scene near the beginning.
John Frick except it was about 30-40 seconds
ComicBook Guy  hello dear could by any chance have a link to this movie in full
Amazing movie, even though some scenes were not in the film.
LyricsVideoZone nope nope
*Cough cough unlike BvS *Cough Cough
Except the hulk in wakanda
Jojo 1961 justice league fan spotted
ComicBook Guy yes this movie was amazing
Well then maybe they are preparing for some new Hulk story
My favorite part was when Thor got his hammer.
ComicBook Guy unlike the amazing spider man 3
It delivered pain that's for sure
DatBoiJohn he was in wakanda during the battle scene
Hotel? Trivago
They did hulk dirty in this movie only 1 transformation I'm pissed that's the only gripe I have
John Moon how is the fishing going so far?
Delivered like super bowl pizza on time before half time
Divine Feline agreed. took my girl to go see it with me, awesome movie, it delivered 👌💯
Planet hulk here we come!
so how was endgame?
Absolutely😩😩🎬🍿🤞🏾
Better than no way home, that was just fan service, this is exciting cause it's awesome not a over hyped nostalgic film.
 @superbattlearena4161  everyone has opinion about being better
but nwh has the greatest hype ever made
I remember my journey to the film and this trailer was insane then, and now.
 @johnsean122  the hype of infinity war and endgame was beyond nwh
 @gukeoke6312  l just thinking why nwh trailer views 355 Millions in 24 hours it pass endgame at 290 million in 24 hours 

does not it make nwh the greatest hype ?
 @johnsean122  it doesn't mean anything, the actual cinematic experience in IW and EG was better than NWH, this is coming from someone who loved nwh too
 @gukeoke6312  l know but if you watch how massive peoples reactions when Tobey show up on cinema that is something like unbelievable/unexpected 

Tobey itself made peoples uncontrolled
 @johnsean122  You clearly didn't see the audience when Cap lifted Mjolnir
 @superbattlearena4161  No Way Home was a goid movie with a excellent plot
 @captainflowers748  and IW and EG were better, just facts, no hatred towards nwh.
I remember being super hyped for this movie, and going to watch it with my best friend and my family when it came out.
Boot leg movies
Super Marvel same bro same
Goosebumps after Spidey is Murdered? Really?
Yep
Every time I watch this I get goosebumps
The same.
Samee
Same oml
Omg ikr
samesamesame
Top class movie
Pamela Johnson
Super Marvel, it happens to the best of us...
Super Marvel ikr?
LyricsVideoZone it won't trust me. Russo brothers are killing it since captian america civil war
same
But it does put a smile on my face...
How would society today face a threat like thanos? Would people still be blaming others? Would there still be social justice warriors and feminists? Would people actually come together for once and forget about hate? What would happen
Yes sir! I agree!
Same
Super Marvel so true...whenever I watch movie or trailer...goosebumps
Yeet
Avengers 4 here we come
Always !
Super Marvel Always !
Super Marvel yes
Super Marvel exactly
Super Marvel  infinity war most ambitious crossover me smash bros ultimate yes
I don't have any goosbump why because I am a DC fan don't reply me
Super Marvel "i hope they'll remember  you"
Lmao this is the exact comment I expected
same here
Super Marvel every time I watch this trailer I get gossebumps
Super Marvel same
Pleasure
Jason Borunda what would happen is that thanos will get the easiest win in his life. The world is so corrupted that even a threat like thanos won't make them team up together.
Same
IKR
Goosebumps even after watching the movie twice
Super Marvel Just saw the movie. It has just been released digitally. I honestly hated it, the movie sucks. It made no sense because I havent watched the other MCU movies. Terrible job really. And the GCI is so off Thanos looks like my dick. So dissapointed in this movie. Can't wait for Sony to show Disney how to make a real movie with Venom
Sam Roberts Sorry but disney have no idea of what they are doing. Can't wait for Venom to be released. Sony knows what they are doing. MCU sucks
Super Marvel same here
Too bad they dont have The Superman. He would kill Thanos in 60 seconds.
Super Marvel, Yeah No turning back now...!
Goosebumps....

EVERY

SINGLE

TIME!!!
True
illuminatisos this trailer let us forget about the sad things.
During covid, when theaters just re-opened, there was not many new movies to show.   Theater in my city did a Infinity War-EndGame double feature. They could only do 25% capacity, so maybe 75 people.  Even though we all knew the movie, to see it on the big screen again and the crowd interaction was special. There was nothing like it before and I doubt there will be again.  You are right in 20 years, when the super hero movies are long dead, a re-release would be huge.  The 10 year old kids would now be 30 and nostalgia will run rampant.
 @locutus1126  That does sound special. There experience in theater is just something else.
Ranjan Kumar bhai kaha se laate ho itti witty lines?
You couldn't watch any MCU movie in 2 years. And where did that bring you ?


Back to the trailer
I LOVE THIS
I saw similar comment in another marvel trailer
just saying
that brought a smile to my face.
 @EE-bg1de  likeways.
Adam J. Harper far from home
Bruhhhh I feel ya
Adam J. Harper false
?
Bruh true true
Adam J. Harper well not those for goodness sake thor Thor is still a thing and falcon now being a new personality for Captain America and black panther and guardians of the galaxy are funny and should I go on in just saying there's more to look forward to so your not always in nostalgia
vdd good
You saw this top comment from the endgame trailer. And where did that bring that you?


Back to the infinity war trailer to copy it.
Copied
Do you REALLY have to copy comments bro?
Adam J. Harper it will never be the same but it will continue strong as long as Kevin feige lives
Adam J. Harper also most of the avengers are still alive like strange spiderman etc
Adam J. Harper no.
 @angryboi801  I more interested in how they decide a fitting end for thor and rest of the original Avengers.
Well played
Adam J. Harper I do agree with you that feminism is ruining the film industry
Haha yeah
haha yes
shen don’t make the same
Someone ?
shen just kiddin’
Honestly tho
true dat
😂😂😂 Very nice man
Dude I did
The current Phase 4 movies or series aren’t even close to the kind of impact End Game or Infinity War had on us (or even a few other Phase 3 movies). God knows what’s happened to their writers & directors.
Dédicace M. Comics from Stan are extremely appreciated. Listen to business war in respect to him 😌
Infinity saga was marvel´s golden era😢
Rest in peace Chadwickboseman
How the hell do you go from this EPIC, to Marvel of today?! I hope they fix it soon.
You watched the trailer of endgame and then the movie itself.
Where did that bring you?
Back to me.
THIS is what Marvel was. Now its over-saturated with too many misses, and not enough hits.
Still in awe that this was the first marvel movie I watched
The biggest scam that Marvel Studio has shown in this trailer was hulks fighting scene at wakanda battle which doesn't happened at all in the movie 😂😂😂
Just feeling the bgm time and time again
wo bhi kya din the mcu.. 🤩🤩
I love how almost everyone was doing the same thing.

1st. was to watch the trailer
2nd. to rewatch a million times
3rd. Rewatch it after Infinitywar
4th. Watching after the EndGame Trailer
MEMORIES. 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
when the MCU was good
World no. 1 trailer🎉
Infinity war increased the blood pressure of fans! The most serious movie that hyped us to seek a way is how Thanos will die! 😅
The best trailer
That Iron Spider suit is sick asf 🔥🔥🔥
5 Years later, I can confirm, this is still just as epic as it was in 2018.
I completely forgot seeing GOG at the end was like WHAAAAAAAATTT??AEWSOOOMEEEEEEEE
It’s been 3 years already get over it.
Lol

Infinite loop
Genius Facts.
God facts
I'm not the only one huh?
It's Dark 5th after Captain marvel 6th after Spider-man far from home trailer and 7th after Spider-man far from home
6.all of them no give subscribers
Accurate  discoveries
I only do 1,2 and 4
WAT! BRUH! YOU'RE A PSYCHIC... cuz that's exactly what I did lmao
5th. Watching 10 years later for the MCU's 20th anniversary.
Marvel Entertainment do not click on this link its a phishing scam, that is not a verified account, look click on the profile picture and you will see that this channel does not have no subs or videos
I find it ugly as shit, especially compared to the old simple one
i crapped my pants when i saw that suit
If only he wasn't more or less a creation of Tony Stark instead of the product of Uncle Ben's teaching I'd be more interested.
Tony did a good job
I know people are gonna bash it because it doesn't look like the comicbook version. It doesn't have to be but that design looks badass and refreshing anyway.
I realized this after watching it years later, but at the end(2:01) they show hulk at the battle of wakanda when in the movie he never came out. Guess they changed that last minute.
back when marvel actually cared about their projects rather than pumping out tons of garbage tv shows and movies to make money
Awesome.
Can't believe this trailer was over three years ago
Nothing, and I mean NOTHING can measure up this hype we had five years ago.
The First 2 Avengers films 
Avengers - 8.9/10
Avengers: Age of Ultron - 9.8/10
We’re pretty good.
I’ll get Avengers Infinity War/Endgame I’ll Check those Out.

Can’t wait to see Avengers: Secret Wars/The Kang Dynasty.
INFINITY WAR is better than ENDGAME
I miss this Marvel, right now it's just constant and blatant cash grabs with mediocre at best writing.
Oh to be able to see this again for the first time....
It's about nine months I first watched this.... but this still gives me goosebumps....
The feeling of having to wait until the following summer to get answers was surreal looking back.
I wonder why they haven't used vision so powerfull but so under ratted 😢 wish they they use character properly
Marvel went from making 2 part masterpieces like this , to making a bunch of unnecessary movies that don't even affect the bigger storyline. They need to focus on quality over quantity.
Chills!!!
Time flies.
This movie and it’s hype will NEVER be forgotten
I remember getting a YT notification and immediately rushing away from my desk to watch this trailer.
Old good days
This movie makes me want to break into someone's house and water their flowers.
As of today may, 2023
This is the most watched Marvel YouTube video with 258 million views
Endgame trailer is 2nd most watched but very far, 150million views
That PFP😂
I love how you only commented this 4 days ago, and it already has 104 likes. This shows how many people rewatch the trailers lol
I remember it like it was yesterday. In fact here i am again 😂 Greatest trailer of all time it still gives me goosebumps
KGF on the way bro...
 @mankindmafia7184  🤨
 @mankindmafia7184  but it won't get close to it in box office
 @grizzlypie8949  I'm Talking about trailer race only not box office race
 @mankindmafia7184  I don't think it can surpass in views also
 @grizzlypie8949  maybe it now but one day it will happen
By
still neeed to watch it
 @MarvelScenes  the views are going up like crazy when we keep seeing it again
 @MarvelScenes  so like video with 1 billion people
 @MarvelScenes  aren’t really 1 billion people
 @MarvelScenes  so yeah
 @MarvelScenes  I hope everyone knows that
Well we didn’t even have marvel in 2020 to soo
Like no marvel in 2020 liked wow
Ikr
Still gives me chills. I was at work when it dropped. And I came home and Just played it on my TV in the Living Room MY KIDS FLIPPED OUT!!! Im glad Me my wife and kids were able to watch this historic movie!!! It was Insane
Yabos Lol
Way to make me feel old
Just shows you how fast time fly's
Uhh me too.
It’s scary that time flys by so fast
 @MarvelScenes  this is easily one of the best cinematic trailers out there. ZSJL Trailer is a good competitor though.
Feel old!
what about no way home
 @treeko101official  Nope. As great as that film was, I don’t think the hype level was even close because Infinity War was being built up since 2012. No Way Home, the hype was just in a year and a half.
with all of marvels failures, where does it lead us, back to this trailer
Its that swell of music when thanos enters titan that always gets me
 @fynnwallis4913  yeah..... when we first see him we get a strong feeling that he is indeed the biggest and the baddest villain in the mcu... it's so epic...
I have never related to a comment more.
 @Tv-man-titan-27281  👍
I think you mean but this does put a smile on my face
Tharindu Hettige the music from 1:27 is epic
I know right
I absolutely agree. Nothing since Infinity War & Endgame has been able to hype me even as remotely.
No way home is nowhere near this movies but you have to admit that its one of the best mcu movie after endgane
I am SO HAPPY that we experienced it before the pandemic... experience of a lifetime. Hope Kang saga will top it
Kgf2 Gonna break this tsr record
 @KishoreKumar-dm6rv  wait, what is kg2?
Original comment 

And funny 😂😂😂
You okay?
WTF Man hahahaha
Lmao Uh sir

LMFAO

Visca Barcelona 
Visca Catalunya
I somehow understand this statement
LMAOOOO barca forever
So, do you just...leave if there's no flowers? Or do you go buy some for them and leave those?
This had me rolling xD
I don’t even know what that means lol
I’m sorry, what?
Most underrated comment
What? 😂
sometimes i get this impulse too
Are you a gardener? 😅 whatever it takes
But it's an action film 😅
😂😂
this comment was stolen from hans zimmer's dark knight theme video
One of the most entertaining movie in the history of cinema.
This movie was the culmination of 10 years of Marvel films. Can't wait for the next 10 years.
Lock down the cinema, engage all screenings ...




and get this man some popcorn.
Can’t get over how amazing this was
I cant wait to have kids, so that when they are old enough we can all binge the entire MCU together and revile what will then be my childhood.
Little Gamora: Did you do it?
Thanos: Yes!
Little Gamora: What did it cost?
Thanos: Another movie!
"Officially wrapped on Avengers 4. It was an emotional day to say the least. Playing this role over the last 8 years has been an honor. To everyone in front of the camera, behind the camera, and in the audience, thank you for the memories! Eternally grateful."
-Chris evans


This is making me cry after a year of not crying.(And yes he actually did say this in Twitter)
Peter: Did we just lose

Doctor Strange: I see this as an absolute win!
Still watching this masterpiece even after the movie..  😍
The trailer: shows Hulk in wakanda

The movie: In terms of HULK

we have no HULK
Can’t believe it’s already been one year since this trailer dropped
It almost feels like I’m watching a mashup trailer between all the movies. This doesn’t feel real. I’m sooo hyped
It's kind of sad when you start comparing the number of characters in this trailer vs the Endgame trailer.
Best time to be alive for comic book films!
Who else is going to watch it multiple times in the cinema? :D
"Will you stop watching Marvel trailers?!"
me: "No, i don't think i will"
Fun isn't something one considers when balancing the universe but this does put a smile on my face.

~ Thanos
I've watched this trailer more than Dr. Strange watched infinity war outcomes😂😂
Not gonna lie, wish I could just strip away my MCU memories at will. Just to watch the series all over again.
Exactly 2 months from now, we will be watching the Avengers 4 trailer.
More like the saddest movie in history
Justin Gary I saw Revenge of the Sith, plus we're talking about Infinity War where Thanos goes around killing everyone for the stones especially some of my favorite characters. Of course I would find it sad in storyline and disappointment.
 @kbraven7007  endgame is more sad
Meh 😴
Justin Gary revenge of the sixth had better writing?
So love has blinded you it seems
Justin Gary same here and also I meant revenge of the sith but since revenge of the sith was the sixth movie so it kinda works
Justin Gary bro it’s their opinion
Most Saddest MCU Movie 😢😢😢😢
Justin Gary Logan was epic
Facts
Justin Gary  those movies bore me, except logan
Justin Gary thanks
Marvel is going woke
 @pipelayer859  wdym "wOkE"?
Patrick Bateman he means they are putting social justice politics over creating entertainment.
Why i am getting the feeling that the next 10 years ain't gonna be as pretty as the last 10 years ?
 @brianneilsen8070  you guys don't want politics in your movies, yet you guys are fans of iron man and the MCU?
 @jessec.6876  No we do want politics in our entertainment. because we of course don't want us to be entertaint while watching entertaintment we want to think about politics. And no of course we aren't fans of this mcu thing whatever that is. that's why  I searched for and watched a 2 year old trailer.
Modafucca
Yeah, but the next avengers still going to have spiderman, falcon with a shield and a ironman a new one. Its the kid who was in the funruel of tony. And still going to have hulk, same with black panther and dr stranger. And so and so but the next is going to be pretty crazy too
 @snipezz9585  aw cmon they are not bringing in that kid to be the new Iron Man.There shouldn't be a new Iron Man at all but Rhodey should come back
 @jessec.6876  i know truth can Hurt. But yeah the kid who was in some part of the iron man movie and in the funruel is going to be the new iron man. But i think thats good
 @snipezz9585  why are you saying the truth when it literally hasn't been confirmed at all? Tony Stark is Iron man we don't need another Iron Man. I'd rather them bring in Riri Williams than that kid back.
10 years ago it was about getting to Infinity War and Endgame.

10 years later. Now It's about getting to Secret Wars.

Just a prediction.
 @isaiahwest9651  what do you mean? Is it coming a avengers secret war??
 @isaaciktaile1118  you are right man, because iron man is gone, black widow captain america
 @snipezz9585  He literally said prediction
 @owais60gamesfunnyvideos73  It's not only about Iron Man or Black Widow or even Captain America actually the literal reason we at least I watched the first Avengers was the OG 6 were together(Where the interactions between themselves made it so cool)  but now I ain't so sure if i am gonna watch the next movies without em' The Russos or whoever directs the next movie they have to really think about how to collect fans like me back
 @isaaciktaile1118 
Yeah I actually mean that now things will be which will don't make any sense
 @owais60gamesfunnyvideos73  You are absolutely correct
 @isaaciktaile1118 
What's your name
SkankHunt 42 sadly...
 @owais60gamesfunnyvideos73  I think that is a question i don't need to or want to answer
I'm weak 🤣🤣
Lol
Haha
Lol that’s how it is
Best COMMENTS EVER
Plz someone get this man more likes 😂😂
That has got to be the best comment I’ve ever seen.
😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂
deserved the like XD
 @mdl_2  Amazing comment lol.
Im going to steel this
Manan Patel i know right, im gonna see it a second time
Except for thanos’ chin 😂
Ikr!
Dammm the best marvel movie ever
This movie is the greatest I have watched the movie twice and trailer more times than I can count
I know, kids say that all the time. You will grow up one day
Apres Midi Guess I'll be a kid for the rest of my life ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. I've seen this twice now, and if you've kept up with all the Marvel masterpieces(excluding a couple), then you know what an amazing story we got so far. Is it bad that I'm on thanos's side?
It was good but the ending sucked ass
They will have to wait a year in between Infinity War and End Game just so that they really experience it like we did
Get this man a wife
Revile?  You want them to "criticize in an abusive or angrily insulting manner" your childhood?
Same man
That would be cool IF and ONLY IF you knew the real truth about this movie. But if you're a millennial then you wouldn't know. And then they won't know and so on and so forth. This movie disrespected SL. I really hate they did that.
 @jpotent1019  i dont understand what are you talking about. What happened with Stan Lee?
 @joako9984  If your asking me that question, then you must be young. It's really late here and there's too much information to tell you all of it. But just ask someone older than you that knows this stuff. I'm not the only one. But maybe another time my friend.
Mateo Phorian why?
BRING ME A4 TRAILER!!!!
Thor Odinson Hey Thor
Zbigniew Delikowski yeah bring it already!!!
Da Dawg hey Da

 @thorodinson4582  amen...thnx Thor Son of Odin. .<3
Shabbizzle Blabbizzle welcome man!!
“Eternally grateful”
“Eternally”

If the title isn’t avengers Eternal at this point I’d be confused
Person Man Or Eternity war
Goodbye cowboy
Why are you crying over an actor ??😂😂
A.J Mulenga Because you don't feel the way I feel? Don't act like everyone has the same emotions as you.
Jack o' Plumkin Just sayin it’s a little weird you crying over somebody who doesn’t know you exist 🤷🏽‍♂️
A.J Mulenga Ok then.
Caps dead
A.J Mulenga actually Cap dies in the movie thats why chris is saying his goodbye :((
ThoseRandomGrowtopians He's saying goodbye because it will be the last time he'll ever do anything for MCU. This doesn't mean that he will die. How does that post make you conclude that he is going to die in AV4?
I mean if you think about it if hes saying his goodbye hes either going to die or just leave since if he didnt leave he would probably not say his goodbye,well if he dies,falcon/bucky will become captain america,get used to that.
ThoseRandomGrowtopians Either Cap retires or he dies. I thought you were assuming that he died.
Jonathon Fyck that was actually hilarious
“Everywhere I go, I see his face”




Talking about you boii
McQueenFAN95 probably just watch the same videos as me boii
Avengers endegame
VooDew no
Iron man: LoOk wHaT yOu JuSt dId
Glacier TheNoobGod 
Agent Hulk: throws taco at stark
Lord Shaggy “Agent Hulk” BRUH
I just realised the moment in the trailer at the end when Hulk runs with the other people in Wakanda doesn't exist in the movie bc Banner can't transform... WHAT IS THIS SORCERY
Daphné Larivière yeaa!
Kaylor styles what do you think about it?
Daphné Larivière,  I think they've saved hulk for the next movie....  Who knows maybe he's gonna play a big role..
So you think that this was a scene from Avengers 4?
Daphné Larivière, 
how?  Lol, no
Kaylor styles I don't understand then how you explain Hulk to be in the trailer and not in the movie...
Daphné Larivière it was fake
Kaylor styles same
Srry Bruce was in the battle not hulk
Its still better than Last of us 2 that featured Joel in trailers which was criminally deceptive
mira11 Horse riding wasnt sufficient enough, atleast play as him after he saved Abby from horde, that would have been better. Plus Hulk's mislead was tolerable than Joel
AHAHAHAAHAHA
Zhongli approves
Im fooking dead 😂😂😂😂
mira11 that’s what I like about the game a bit. The Irony. The last time u play as Joel your riding off in the sunset and the starts off with Joel, and ends with Joel, the game respects Joel, but the writing to kill him off was done poorly and was a spit in the face. But I also will say that it wasn’t a story we wanted, but it was a story that needed to be told. It’s realistic
Lol I have watched the movie as everyone never noticed plus watched the trailer again did not notice when I saw your comment I noticed lol
Thanos: I have an army

Marvel’s Avengers: Infinity War | Official Trailer: We don’t have a hulk
Spoiler alert
Starting of the movie there was hulk when he fights w thanos ( starting scene ) although that was v less
Wow never imagined a fellow tf2 gamer to be found here
Stop it get some help
Stop what
Same bro,i feel you
And that there’s still no avengers 4 trailer
I remember seeing this trailer and Justice League around the same time. When a trailer is better than the supposed epic teamup movie... that's when I stopped being a stubborn DC guy.
Same
same feel
Viqtor Word.
Same here too
Ikr
Viqtor That's exactly how I feel now...
ikr
50%
Beacuse half of the unvierse is dead lol
If you see the endgame cast, you can see a lot more characters. Even the dead ones.
Where you git that heart pirates picture?
 @stephenyutuc9468  This is the symbol of the Donquixote Pirates not the Heart Pirates. Just google "Donquixote Pirates Jolly Roger" and you should be able to find it.
 @CipherPol13  oh yaI didnt notice the line in the middle
TheSmilingKnight but the likes are coming close tho
Endgame in general media has 294m
I guess you could say it’s a split issue
Ikr
TheSmilingKnight they can’t spoil he characters that have not been in movies before and that’s probably meaning theirs going to be a lot of characters not in the movies before
Ain't this the truth.
Unless you work for Warner Bros.

 @kodiak6330  to bring together a group of remarkable people
 @kodiak6330  to see if they could become something more
 @quochoile8094  so that when they needed us we could fight the battles
 @kodiak6330  that they never could
 @nickcheung7592  in time you will know what it's like to lose

 @micahtairea7757  he wasn’t evil,he had different ways of seeing things
I wish they put this line in the movie
 @phantomblizzard7756  yeah maybe
 @kimberm.3305  There is a similar one in Endgame. " In all my years of conquest, violence, slaughter, it was never personal. But what I'm about to do to your annoying little planet, I'm gonna enjoy it , very very much

Infinity war trailer released - 29 nov 2017
Infinity war movie released - 27 april 2018.
Similarly... 
Avengers 4 movie release - 26 april 2019(official in UK)
So, Avengers 4 trailer has to be released on 29-30 nov 2018. Which is 2 months from now.
 @the_zereth  ooh I thought the movie was on May 9th
 @drigihat454  well, the movie will be coming out on 26 april 2019 in Uk where as 3 may 2019 in usa.
Anyway, we'll get to watch the trailer between 29 nov to 7 dec. It shouldn't be any late.
 @the_zereth  yeah... 'bout that I don't think so, marketing is focused on captain marvel expect the real name to be released within 2 months
Yeah probably
 @the_zereth   dam the trailer coming out 2 months after my bday with is today
IT'S SINKING IN
Well ......... time to freeze myself
One of you guys defrost me 2 months from now okay
the trailer release dates arent an exact thing, you do realise that right? this was released with the original release date for the 4th of may, so just over 6 months between releasing the first trailer and the actual movie, we got a captain marvel trailer like two weeks ago, 5 and a half months before release. the way i see it, marvel studios arent gonna release a trailer for a movie this important until at least january.. early release would be nice though (sorry for long comment, i normally dont like to do it)
well no it isnt. the avengers was renamed to avengers assemble for UK release, they're the same movie
Reeeaaaaly😀😀😀😀
 @the_zereth  check imdb
M. lol
the ZERETH teaser trailer probably in January.
Omg I can't wait

Friends: Y'all will still grow tired of watching this Trailer


Me: Some people move on....BUT NOT US
Thanos: Fails

Covid-19: Fine. I will do it myself
Infinity war: epic, all out war, shocking, unexpected
Engame: aftermath, nostalgia, memories, wholesome and one last epic fight

Engage all concession stands,
And get this fan a ticket!
Those days when you were going to school to talk to your friends about INFINTY WAR
Who else is here waiting for the Avengers 4 trailer?
Rigby same thing happened at my cinema
Rigby i exploded
Rigby BRING ME THANOS!
Me:*ded*
Rigby Yeah that scene and when Cap appeared from the Shadows was good to
That was epic moment
I literally was shaking in my seat during that part! Sent chills down my spine!
LegendaryAlex I don't feel so good
Rigby my ears was bleeding at that time
" I am Groot! "
" I am Steve Rodgers, "
Rigby ikr that's what happened at the theater
which country? mine was quiet
When I enter wakanda the half of world explodes
Everyone started Cheering and it was the day the movie came out
I cried
I legit started the clapping and screaming In mine 😂
Thanos still have the time stone.
Who know that he may become so curious to watch avengers 4 too, and go see it with the time stone.
:p
Boom!
He also watched all of the MCU movies like 14,000,605 times already
And he hasn't spoiled it for anyone.
Dr. Strange better keep his mouth shut. Wait never mind.
Lol
Chozhan Mamallan That is a amazing point and your Comment deserves more recognition 🤓
Pokegalplayz thanks man!!😀😀
He saw 14 million versions of avengers 4 and didn’t spoil a single one
Chozhan Mamallan Np 😉
teleto nhlapo he spoiled all of them because he said they die in everyone but one
A cute sparky..
NIBIN its a quote from Ragnorok
Lmao🤣
Any one know reasons??

 @qvc1212  it's not THAT good hahaha
yes, it is
Same
Oh come you stole my joke
i watch this like 3 times a day hahahaha
best trailer everrrrrrr!
Woah! 
This trailer can't be unhealthy.
She's a Super Freak! It’s pretty much the equivalent of hype music for me at this point.
SAME
I've watched big chungus episode to much
Lol same
 @qvc1212  I DO AGREE
same
We’re in the same boat. I’ve watched this to the point I know every line and how the song goes
Same
That part was on when I read this istg-
I know it is marvelous

Salzan Biten underrated comment
It is sad that the avengers aren't in our real lives.
So true
ANITA SINGH There are.

First Responders/Paramedics, Doctors/Nurses, Delivery folks, they are our heroes out there.
Did Thanos fail?


Well yes, but actually no.
😂😂😂👌
 @ANITASINGH-ot4ll  as if they'd be able to do anything against a virus
 @georgelinford5576  Bruce Banner is one of the best scientists in history and Tony Stark managed to discover  a new element. Together they created Ultron (in the movies) and discovered time travel.
Not to mention other super smart characters in comics like Hank Pym and Reed Richards.
Yeah... I think they could help.
Howard Shevill true
Yeah but covid 19 is a hoax
Santos Mendoza please tell me your joking
Amin Kartoev nope
Santos Mendoza i’ve heard this theory too many times, no 1 everyone knows that either a war or a biological virus or infection will wipe out humanity or take a chunk of it, and bill gates knows it himself he donates regularly to ebola and malaria research and 5g is just a signal that’s not dangerous, if it’s dangerous you would be dead as light is more dangerous than 5g
Amin Kartoev you don’t know what 5g is , 5g and the microchip are connected
In witch a thanos line?
Salzan Biten underrated bro
Santos Mendoza how did he know? Cause virus have been throughout all of human history. I will tell you right now there will be another virus after covid 19.
 @santosmendoza4685  are you joking?
 @ANITASINGH-ot4ll  just stay at home and let's doctors do the workn
I never lose
 @SomeOne-mr9fe  🤝
 @MMZERO9  so true
 @MMZERO9  NHS most of all 🤗
Cursed Comment
So real
HAhaha 😂 good one
 @georgelinford5576  Ant-Man could ☻
Underrated comments 😂
Covid19 created by Hydra
Actually Thanos achieved it
You couldn't leave without your mask and where did that bring you??
Underrated
AVENGERS LEVEL TREAT
Apex Latex this is literally the first reply I see to every top comments on videos
thanos didnt fail, he technically won
 @MMZERO9  you right. Thank you for all their service
 @ANITASINGH-ot4ll  the doctors are the avengers
Avengers are not superhuman, they are corporate puppets, acting for money. Don't connect you're real memory with reel memory.
Thanos did not fail.
Oh, snap!!!!
Wooah that was quite dark.
True
XD
Frontliners: in time, you will know what its like to lose, to feel so desperately you are right, yet to fail all the same
@Thanos Wait a second.....
Epic fight
Glad u didn't compare them
It’s people like you who can see this that I appreciate. I know multiple people who said Endgame was weak because “it didn’t have that much action”. Bruh this is the final movie. A send off to the characters we grew to love. You want action? Theres millions of movies for that. How about a closure to the saviors of the universe? We only get one chance for that here. Infinity War & Endgame went together perfectly like Yin & Yang.
 @piscesreacts1147  yup also we have seen actions in IW so why to need in EG again. Remember both are 1 movie
 @bullymaguire5873  Exactly. One movie, but like 2 sides to the same coin.
 @piscesreacts1147  yep. IW is not a masterpiece and EG also but if we see it together then it is a masterpiece
 @bullymaguire5873  "You think you know how the world works.."
Facts
YES! Just like many people here who replied to you, I'm glad you didn't compare them saying Infinity War is much better or Endgame is much better, but rather you stated what they had that made each unique and fit into one grand 5.5 hour movie (if you preferred one over the other, that's fine with me; I prefer Endgame slightly, but I also love Infinity War a ton).
i have only prob, I didnt expect Hulk like that in infinity war or in endgame
 @rohitmanohar2733  I agree; I wish Hulk did more in both films. He didn't even last a minute against Thanos and just seemed like a brute in fighting despite his two years of training in Sakaar shown through his fight with Thor in Ragnarok, and in Endgame, even though his arc makes sense (people are scared of the Hulk, as well as Banner, who can't control it, but now he can, and everyone loves him), I wish he did more in the final battle, like maybe he would be the one to destroy the ship instead of Captain Marvel. Both films didn't utilize him the right way, and I'm not saying these films are flawless (imo they're 8/10 in terms of quality), but they're near-equal, as I'm tired of audiences saying IW >>> EG and critics saying EG >>> IW.
Before The Credits I need to watch every single mcu movie
Before The Credits :-?
Before The Credits better be. I'm going in dry
what do u mean not ready? everyone waited for this for a long time now
You have till may to prep your body
Rest In Peace Chadwick Boseman
yeah i now remeber a meme 
B.P :  get this man a shield
thor : bring me thanos
B.P : get this man a thanos
 @marvelgaming5806  I have seen that before!
i was in tears after that hahahahahahaha
DELTA EDITS 😂😂
Lol and the other weird thing is Batista is bigger than Chris I think
“ONE sandwich away from fat”
DELTA EDITS the whole cinema laughed
HAHAHAHAH
WHERE’s GAMORA?
What’s Gamora.

...Why is Gamora?!

Dying of Laughter
While this movie was very serious and full on, for me the humor was PERFECT! 

"You're embarrassing me in front of the wizards."
Geralt of Rivia LOL
Sup Geralt, how's Ciri doing?
not in one day bro in 15 hours only
We have to support both companies to have more movies of our favorite characters <3
and I thought that geral was not stupid, because to compare the marvel fandom that has been making movies for 10 years with the one of DC that has 4 movies, the truth is not very intelligent
Geralt of Rivia id did not reach 24 hours yet
not one day it's only 15 hours 😎😎😎
Thank you for blessing me with this comment.
Geralt of Rivia Actually I'm looking at Justice League views and it still frozen at 28M views these past months lmao
Lol actually JL is on 28M right now
28*
actually less then one day
The.essential. wolf The Justice league movie hits with 28M views. However the Avengers movie in 2012 is at 26M views and still stands better than Justice league standing today. So it isn't really about views. It's about how well they did the movie.
Geralt of Rivia OOF
Probably because infinity war was built up. Justice league was still the first movie. Avengers trailer couldn't even hit 20 million when it came out. when i
Chewbacca Buddy yep me
In time this trailer will know what it's like to be dethroned...
Evin Maguire don’t worry just a lil while until Avengers 4 trailer comes
me too
 @lillianhyatt8462  "a lil' while"
it still gives me goosebumps, first time watching or not. It's truly spectacular :)
Probably like last year the trailer will play during the Superbowl
 @lillianhyatt8462  I can't wait that long. We gonna have to wait at least till November or December sadly
I wish I could watch the movie for the first time again.
Same. I was so hype it made me cry
I wish I could watch the movie for the first time again

It makes me cry
Nostalgic days man, nostalgic days...
why u talking like it was 10 year ago lmao.its been 2 years
 @mzont8039  cause the last 6 months have felt like 10 years
I hate those fcking days because they spoiled me the movie, luckily not for endgame because school was over for me :)
 @armandguillen6149  well,my friends talk who's gonna kill thanos...not Spoil the movie..
 @darthsidious2952  I was saying precisely after the release, after they watched it first, I misunderstood lol
 @armandguillen6149  oh my bad
Ahhh memory
Ya
Good old times .......
i'm waiting for the new Shazam trailer.
Spencer Carroll does anyone know when it comes out? I honestly thought it would come out yesterday or today.
All marvel fans waiting avengers 4
 @Quwv397  I think next week.
Lol yessss!
No sign of it still!😥
Next month, so don’t get your panties in a bunch...




init
Me
Remember when this trailer dropped and we couldn’t wait any longer and wanted now? I missed being hyped for a movie
Captain America looks so fuckin badass.
Rip Stan Lee... Thank you for everything.
Probably gonna be #1 on trending till the next trailer comes out
Watching this trailer does not makes me bored... Its been above 2000 times i watched this😂😍😍
30 years later
Son: Dad, who were the avengers?
Me: there was an idea
Just saw Black Panther again, the hype is even higher after that movie!
Morgan: i love you 3000
Thanos: i love you 1500
Every time I see this i get more excited
Let's be honest:
This is not the first time you come here
I'm watching this every single day ! ❤️
Some people stop watching this trailer.....but not us(thanks for the likes!!!)
I just need to stay alive until may 4.
I feel like Coronavirus is speaking instead of Thanos...
It's been almost 4 years...
Oh god.
Today marks the 2 year anniversary of the release of this trailer
Cap returns as the badass he really is......cant  wait
#TeamAvengers
Can’t believe today has been 4 years since this movie was released.
Glad I never skipped a credit scene
Avengers - it will be easy
Now avengers - whatever it takes
Yeah and I’ve basically lost interest in Marvel by now. Endgame was the end for me.
 @justthereed5593  trust me theres much more. it may be the end of the OG avengers we all know and love but there will still be marvel and the nostalgia when we watch the newer movies. There is still hope
Hopefully the next ten years can do it again
Corooonaa vaaiures😀
 @meysam1380  same here
This movie is ironically very symbolic. If you think about it after Endgame, it was basically the end of movie theaters.
Dopamine
 @bushyncharge  dope
 @yuvrajguglani821  same every where
Yea the hype was real
Now we can be hyped for black widow yay 😒
Language!!
Tony looks 100x more so
Sohail Ansari 

It’s a joke referring to one of the movies
Sohail Ansari its the beard
Sagar informatics pvt. ltd. 😂😂😂
Redstone Pro not really. The dude looks slick, but most certainly not badass
Sohail Ansari IKR
Yeah! Dirty, homeless Cap.
Spiderman looks badass
Who'd have thunk it before the creation of the MCU?  I mean,  I don't want to sound like I'm shitting on Cap, I love Cap, he was one of my favourite heroes growing up, but who would have thought modern cinema audiences would go for a character that is basically a walking propaganda poster?  
Way back when, I thought the only way they could do Captain America for 21st century audiences was like a cross between early Kurt Angle (when he first joined WWF with his "holier-than-thou" "God Bless America"- schtick and Austin Powers (clueless fish-out-of-water/man out of time).
I'm happy to be wrong about that!
Jack Woodgate It think Chris Evans fits perfect for the role of Captain America. I don't think kurt angle would have been a good choice
Damn hell yeah he looks badass brother.. If he dies i really m gonna freak out and loose my shit and will probably beat the hell out of some audiences watching the movie😑😑
Rohit Raj Same here i'll be right behind ya.
You mean solid snake boy oh boy he look so metal gear
I thank Stan Lee for making a part of my life meaningful.
Yep
Marvelmania360 And in Russia
Zia Khan 1000 times for me. You're welcome😂😂
bro, it would be more than 2000  times for me as I watched the trailer 5-7times every day from the second its release. yes second, I had watched the trailer as soon as I got the notification on my phone. and at the time it only had 3200 views.
Amen
Same.

U guys just wasting all your time, anime is better

To see if we could become something more
 @alexsolimani  so when they needed us, we could fight the battles...
 @ruslanchernenko6149  That they never could.
Marvel theme song INTENSIFIES
In time you will know what its like to lose.
To feel so desperately that you're right, yet to fall all the same.
Dread it, Run from it, Destiny still arrives
Evacuate the city,engage all defenses and get this man a shield.

 @ccelite3782  and you understand me too
Patrick Thomas Why do you think like that?
 @rohambahraee  Jesus Christ man its been a year.
How innocent we were last year not knowing how emotional the next Avengers movie was gonna be...
 @ccelite3782  Sorry man for the late reply, yeah you are right. Endgame was emotional on another level
 @rohambahraee  EndGame hit much harder seeing how deeply it affected all our favorite heroes 😭
 @ccelite3782  Yes, some people or heroes have to be sacrificed so others can live a better life
 @rohambahraee  i was crying when the heroes dusted and cried out of happiness when they came back thinking "we won!" But then Tony snapped and then i ended up crying again...
 @ccelite3782  Yes it's hard but as Tony said "part of the journey is the end" and what better way to give your life for the people you love
 @rohambahraee  i know but... his death hit different. Pietro sacrificed himself but it just wasn't sad.
my 7th - 10th i remember  Obsessing over this trailer when i was 13, i still get  Goosebumps over this trailer.
Ehh. I suppose you're right. 

I feel...compelled to revisit it every now and then. 

The heart pounding anticipation of this was epic. I don't think I've ever wanted to see any other movie THIS BADLY in my entire life.
It actually is. But I understand why it wouldn't be
It is, I'm going to watch this movie for the first time today.
And not the last time
it is actually but hopefully not my last time ^^
Let's be honest:
 This is not the worst thing you've caught me doing
Idk how many times I've watched this trailer...Oh my God,I missed the moments greatly...

Adam Lane plot twist: Coronavirus is Thanos.
"Dread it, run from it, destiny still arrives" -this sounds exactly like what the Coronavirus would say if it was a person
same bruh
Covid-19 is nothing but a scapegoat for a hidden global agenda.
"You couldn't live with your own failure, where did that bring you... back to me"
what u said boy
Always one conspiracy nutter, go on then, explain your theory using logic and objective facts
It is
 @larryfoulkeofficial8609  I'm assuming you believe that my statement is wrong and ludicrous?
dude someone is thanosing the world with the coronavirus
Coronavirus is real life version of Thanos.
 @bereanathlete723  yes i do
Doctors assemble
HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAH OMFG YESSS
 @bereanathlete723  yep
 @sebaa7308  How do you account for knowing anything at all?
 @bereanathlete723  They don't know anything, but that's not the point. The point is they don't want to know, so anyone who tries to use their brain and think, there will be those who are puppets who will always have something negative to say instead of using their brains and coming up with something logical to counter. Don't bother with them or you'll just waste your time.
 @lordgainz5192  Yeah I hear ya Broseph. As fun as it would be to show them how absurd and futile their unbelieving worldview is, I best just go about and share with someone else who is an honest inquirer as it would be more fruitful and productive.

There is a huge difference between evidence and persuasion; most people (if not all) who immediately resort to ad hominems could care less about any kind of both quantitative and qualitative evidence that you provide them because of their underlying precommitments in how they interpret the facts.
Ikr
Jan Asamoah I saw this comment right when he said it on the trailer lol
Exactly
Ok bucky Barnes

Yup
Tbh
Time has gone way too quickly-_-
Yea
Yes
3 Years...
It's probably not "cap" anymore.
He dies..
Cap is mediocre.  Right up there with Hawkeye and Widow.  If they're dealing with Eternals, Celestials, and Thanos then they better get some more help like a serious galactic heavy hitter like Silver Surfer
punkrocknerd don't underestimate black widow captain America and Hawkeye
MysticNoot and it’s still not on Disney plus yet lmfao
 @originalsomecloud3349  because it's still on Netflix
NinjaEfor YTッ ik that I’m just saying that since Disney owns marvel shouldn’t they have it but nooo they don’t and this movie should have been on Disney plus over 2 years ago!
 @originalsomecloud3349  dude disney plus wasn't even made 2 years ago and also Netflix is popular and has a lot of great content and Infinity War is in Netflix for entertainment for people watching Netflix
One Thou Wou ok
MysticNoot why are you even talking or even feeling threatened by this kid 😂
Irvin Robledo it’s sarcasm lmfao 😂😂😂 Homie his roast or insult was mad corny 🤣🤣🤣🤣

Others : "Heroes always win at the end of the movie, like usual"
Infinity War : "sorry, we don't do that here"
I remember I saw this trailer minutes after it got posted. It was stuck at 544k views for like an hour. Then the views blew and this went straight to Trending #1 for a week. Can't believe it's been a year lol
Thor : bring me thanos 👌
Captain marvel : bring me grandma 😇
Marvel fans : bring me avengers 4 trailer🙏🏻

This trailer made more money than Justice League
This is still the best movie trailer ever
It was leaked like 3 months ago my son
R-A-H_- yes indeed...but the quality of the leak trailer...
R-A-H_- I really wanna see an HD version of that trailer!
Ojas Padalkar yup true
The best part about that trailer is... it is merely the beginning
Ojas Padalkar 
I hate to say this, But this one is fake too.
Perhaps next month/year.
Auke Kaptijn 
That’s like saying that a Macintosh isn’t an apple, but I see what you’re getting at....
NeonMillennium8 8 
It's quite similar as the first avengers.
1. Loki has the tesserekt
2. Unleashes an army
Thanos is the gamechanger.
I'm however very excited about this movie.
(Don't mind my grammar)
Auke Kaptijn 
Ah ok, yea I guess that makes sense. I am also quite excited, as I’m sure everyone is 😄

Hello Cupcake
I relate xD
yeah, Guardians jokes that actually worked... minor miracle
they should BEG those writers to do all of their screenplays in future films
Michael G Agreed
Drax
Soundwave Superior, Autobots Inferior “Did you do it?”
Dr Soap “Hi, Drax.”
Hahahaha I am invisible
I have stand for so long i have the ability to become invisible to the human eye
Kenon Hinokami I thought I was invisible
Why is gamora?
johan majid “Mr Stark, I don’t feel so good”
Kiss 😂
“Get lost squidward!”
Dr Soap why is gamora?
That one was really good.
Laughed really hard at that one
That was hilarious 😂😂😂
"Hi Drax!"
"Dammit..."
Draxx❤️
Dr Soap "how much for the arm?"
awh man this was by far the saddest moment in the MCU for me, he's just a kid
Dr Soap that shit was funny and when mantis asked what he was doing and he said damn and walked away 😂😂
Dr Soap LMAO
Dr Soap 🤣🤣🤣
Dr Soap I'm sure I'm invisible
Guardians low key stole all the scenes they were in. 😂
that part was funny
Michael G "the kid’s seen more movies”
Dr Soap lol
I have mastered the art of standing so still, that I become completely invisible.
Dr Soap 😂😂😂
Kenon Hinokami who is dr soap?
Dr Soap “ why was she up there all this time”
Dr Soap haha I get that
"We kick names and take ass!"
"That's right"
I love tht part
Lol this comment is so funny
'I am Groot'
'I am IronMan'
Huh??? Drax was in this movie? Didn’t see him at all ~_~
omg haha, I remember this scene xD
"I'll do you one better"
"Why is Gamora"
I bought the bank, ohhh. wrong movie.😥
wow I watch this movie last night it was really good but it was about 3 hours long please like
''When im done...half of humanity will still exist.''
Arash Kenway I hope they remember you.
"If i stand very still i will become invisible"
eejita eejita yea that was inaccurate, even if thanos has the power stone, hulk would of gamma punch the entire shit destroy but they made him look like a regular rock guy.
Funniest part of the movie
Dr Soap 😂gj
I'll do you one better, "why is Gamora"
Michael G uhhh most of the funny lines are actually the actors/actress improv....
''My movements are so slow that I'm invisible for your eyes''
Dr Soap
That was my favorite part of the whole movie
"You're embarrassing me in front of the wizard"
Not gonna lie that was the one good part of this bad movie i am being blunt while polite lets see if u guys can match the movie was...frankly quite badly made but that one quote was the only thing i though was worth seeing. And epic i hope thats a joke if u want epic go watch lotr they make every other movie made look like a joke and this is no exception
johan majid when is gamora
Dr Soap dude no one answered the question 





WHY IS GAMORA??!!
Drax
Michael G I hope you know James Gunn wrote all of the lines for the guardians in this movie
Funniest part of these three hours xD
Dr Soap
"I bet I'm invisible"
"Hi drax"
"Damn it"
Dr Soap my favourite part!!!!
"Where is Gamora?" 
"Alright lemme ask u a question who is Gamora?"
"Alright here's a better one, WHY IS GAMORA?"
"Kick names, take ass"
that is what I was about to post
Mantis:Hi drax!
Drax:god damn it
i love that scene XD
Dr Soa
Dr Soap after the end credits 
“How long have you been sitting there?”
“An Hour”
Seriously
Dr Soap me
H20iceGaming It’s Not For Sale.

Harrypotamus ! Hah lol
He fist bumps thanos is the post credit scene
The Legend27 I bet you it's going to be this (THANOS WALKS IN THE PORTAL STAN LEE 2 SECONDS LATER SAYS HEY I KNOW THIS GUY)
The Legend27 he's dead hows he gonna do it
Connor Chisholm dude no he's not
Stan lee will destroy thanos by flicking him
eternity
I swear, If Stan takes the Gauntlet from Thanos and saves the day, I'm (for once) gonna let that Ex-Machina slide.
Sansimations yeah me too
The Legend27 I hope an actual Watcher shows up.  Preferably Uatu
I should have stayed at my house in queens-Stan lee
The Legend27 
I wonder what it will be in something like this

Even Black Panther
I think stan lee is gonna be a watcher
i bet when he passes they CGI him in the movies
Givens Raymond ok mate but u have clearly had no one in ur family be in a car crash ik what u mean but trust me it doesnt come close

Hawkeye will avenge!
Hola.  Tantos

ReikoChannel lmfao 😂😂😂ikr

al jareau Abad they did it to mislead us
Reza Z dont worry I've got this buddy that works for Sony and he told me they have the rights to another tom holland Spider-Man movie so he'll return
vs k 
glory
vs k why can we see hulk charging to battle ? And not in the movie ?
Ten tak they also showed 2 infinity stones on gauntlet where actually 4 stones were there(battle on Titan) ..... They're just fooling around
And even without Hulk,  that scene didn't happen
great line
If they can't save them they could damn well avenge them.
Reza Z yeah Adam warlock brings us back
vs k they did it with Thors new hammer in the trailer but I could imagine a cool way how it would work :with time travel in the next movies I don’t Think any trailer done this.
Wish your comment had a question mark at the end... :(

 @matthewk2501  no loki is not dead the Russo Brother's, Marvel, and Disney already confirmed that in Avengers 4 (a.k.a Avengers Infinity War Part 2) every single Marvel Character in the whole MCU since the timeline started will be posed in a shot doing an action shot and that all the one's that died in Infinity War will be in the shot even the cameos that were in every single MCU movie from the very beginningthat includes Red Skull and some Villains, Stan Lee, and some characters from the comic books.
Tredvert 809 well the directors of spiderman far from home already confirmed that the movie timeline will take place after Avengers 4 (a.k.a Avengers Infinity War part 2) when everyone and everything is back to normal i bet and that the movie is going to be released after Avengers 4 (a.k.a Avengers Infinity War part 2) so that is not true for what you said
Yes u correct
super hero's club  yup
true
Yep there was even a marvel movie marathon from timeline order and I even did my own binge watching of the mcu movies in the timeline order(captain America the first avenger-black panther)
F youuuuuuu
Yourtacoguy_ 57 Isn't Thor Ragnarok the latest in the timeline
It's really a festival for  Marvel's fans
Kaden Chai yeah during gotg 2 I got confused

ACTUALLY, infinity war took place in 2017, even though the movie came out in 2018.

forza juventus Yea, because the Avengers got back the lost half. Come on. Did you even watch Endgame.
forza juventus It's a joke. Endgame got half of the views Infinity War did, right? And then the views increased by a lot because they got everyone back in Endgame.
YOOOOO WUUUUT
 @thebrandonrobert5693  bruh i dont watched Endgame
But professor hulk snaps,and other 113 million watched the endgame trailer
😝😝😝😝😂😂😂😂
Coincidence?

Omg
Half of the universe saw it
Perfectly balanced as all thing should be
Thanos snapped half the views away

 @p4radox27  Thanos snap effect is back 😂
Now infinity war : 245m views
Endgame trailer : 142m views
 @BossCrazyRoss  and yet Infinity War is the better movie. Double the views bud. 245m for IW vs 142m for Endgame. Checkmate.
 @imshubhajit  if Endgame gets 103 million in the next 1 and half years
 @willseest3732  You do know that the total views aren't counted only based on YouTube, right?
This will always be the most hyped movie

The Best Thing About The Trailer.
That whole thing in the end of this trailer where they towards was not in the movie tho 😂
There’s a deleted scene for that, they cut it out to help with the pacing
 @alecro2112  I saw it, wish they kept it in so we didn’t get smart hulk out of no where if you don’t watch for small clues
 @dylannguyens9367  Agreed, but apparently it was cut cause it provided a moment of hope in the otherwise relentless ending of Infinity War, and they were too far along in production to shoot new scenes for Endgame where smart hulk doesn’t just come out of nowhere.
 @alecro2112  makes sense, I appreciate the knowledge
Blame toy company's
Well to combine all the "original  Avengers"with their powers  that's why he is not in a suit
That was necessary as to not give any spoilers. If anything I really appreciate marvel for doing that
Manisha Parmar lol so true
Really???
Prashant shetty no, ofcouse yes i mean what i say
Manisha Parmar right!!! i know what your'e saying
Manisha Parmar have to watch it at least once a day until infinity war
Manisha Parmar .
same
true
P0P M0NTREAL is it fake or real
Wow i read it when T'challa said get this man a sield😂😂
Dimitris Papadopoulos lolllll😂
Wrong he can’t come in 🙅🏾‍♀️🙅🏾‍♀️
 @bettyshabazz4092  Yes, he can, John Wick doesn't need your premission. Wakanda isn't good enough for the legendary John Wick tho, lmao.
In time,you will feel what its like to lose,to feel so desperate you're right,but yet to fail-Thanos
😂😂
Tiesha Lawrence yess let him in
800th like
Bandanacat woooo🥳
Jhon wick les saca la mierda a todos
a pencil, huh? do you want to see a magic trick?
fried chicke u r god
That would be amazing!
I don’t get it
 @blast6707  it's a joke
fried chicke your a legend. I want a petition to be started
It would be cool if he tried, but basically ends up effecting him similar to how superman would and Antman can't expand because of Thanos having his durability up and ends up hurting ant man in the process.
Om
 @blast6707  you don't get what?
lol Marvel shouldn't lose this 2 sec comic escape opportunity
There is no time joke it's time for the intense atmosphere
Everything You Want Is Here the same was said for infinity war, look at that movie
 @elcabezon2222  i see u everywhere lol
*of
That would be the best part of the movie aside from hulk’s rematch
princeofpersiarulz black panther beated it I think
Raven it didn't beated it in international, only in domestic it beated it
princeofpersiarulz hi
Jean Morgan hi how are you
BILL GATES INDRUETIES STUIDOS
EA: in time you will know what’s it like to lose money. Feel so desperate but your incorrect yet to lose money all the same..
princeofpersiarulz 
When no other superhero movie ever could. yet
Marvel to dc- in time you will know what it’s like to lose money. To feel so desperately that you’re the best superhero franchise yet to fail all the same. Dread it run from it infinity war still arrives. Fun isn’t something one considers when balancing a fan base but this does it a smile on my face
6dig-S 61 only avengers 4 maybe
you forgot "put"
Justice league is a oof
princeofpersiarulz black panther was a better written movie though and I think it’s a fact at this point. It’s also far better paced making it in my opinion a better film
The TMG Specialist you think? Maybe written idk but imo infinity war is better. If you call me racist I swear i will break
vertrau Auf ihn why do you think that? Infinity war from what I watched was a lot of forced unfunny comedy and bad written character decisions, the rest was fine. Il give it a 7.8/10. It was enjoyable but when I critique something it needs to have substance behind the toppings
The TMG Specialist it’s not about the comedy imo it’s the action. The movie was very action packed. I liked black panther a lot though. It’s just my opinion though no need for an argument
vertrau Auf ihn so you like it better because it has more action? That’s all I got from your response
The TMG Specialist imo yes. I mean I liked the story too but with this movie literally every scene had me at the edge of my seat. I mean we all have our opinions though. I really liked black panther and I really liked infinity war. Both great movies
vertrau Auf ihn To each there own I guess
yeah it was one of their tricks.  I wonder why they didn't just show the hulkbuster armor.  we wouldn't have known who was in it.  then youtubers could "endlessly speculate" about who was in it.
 @billyjacobs190  Plus they already showed the hulkbuster in the trailer
They considered showing Hulk becoming smart Hulk in this movie and even shot the scene. Maybe at the time they released this trailer that scene was in but they removed it later.
Some of this footage is from a different universe. >>
 @wanderer1818  if you check the sky of the footage, you may see a couple of eyes...
 @hamzamir7784  Es una estrategia que usa Marvel para engañar o guardar algo para la película , igual está pasando con el Tráiler de Spiderman No Way Home
 @diegoangeloalejosdiaz5221  No hablo espanol
 @hamzamir7784  It is a strategy that marvel uses to deceive or save something for the movie. The same is happening with the trailer for spiderman no way home.
 @hamzamir7784  I think it was a trick.  Like when they showed Thanos' gauntlet with different stones than what was actually there in the movie.
 @billyjacobs190  i dont think they paid someone to animate Hulk running in that shot just for a trick. I'm pretty sure it was a deleted scene or something. In Thanos's case it would've actually costed them less to animate two instead of the actual four.stones on his gauntlet.
 @hamzamir7784  yeah I guess that's true.
They deadass lied to us lol
FALSE ADVERTISMENT
💯
It's a scam
What will you do father. You can no longer hide behind the skirts of Athena
 @hamzamir7784  if you don’t speak spanish you can press the translate button under his comment to read in your language
 @toemuncher3333  i dont see a translate button , dude
 @hamzamir7784  oh, maybe you need to update your app, anyway if it helps I’ll translate it for you
 @hamzamir7784  it is a strategy that Marcel uses to deceive or save something for the movie so you don’t get spoiled, the same will happen to no way home, the three spider men hopefully coming back and not showing all the villains
 @toemuncher3333  I'm using the browser version. Either way its all good my mate, somebody here already translated it but thanks <3
 @hamzamir7784   Do you know what google translate is tho?
If hulk was there in wakanda fight vision would be alive as Thor has much tym to kill thanos and hulk can easily destroy thanos army single handily
Smart chi🌝
MCU ruined Hulk
Who’s ready for  the NWH trailer ???
iiVirgilPlayz well it’s been less time lol
When I am done... Half will still exist...
But this has been out longer
Nah there were more re-uploads for endgame trailer go to Wikipedia to see the real number
iiVirgilPlayz But Endgame made more money
230M in 1 year. 115M in a half month.
I don't think that they can take the fact that this is pure irony :|
End game was better In my opinion
Oh god the irony in that.
Infinity war better then endgame
Lmaooo
i think infinity war is better
Many didn't watch all the trailer so they got 'less spoiler' as possible
Thanos snaps
 @maz3rlaz3r15  yea lol
Let time pass , the avengers will revive the rest half and they will increase the view count. Only year has passed. It took 5 years for the mouse to click button. So be patient. 😆😆
I think most of these replies missed the point of your comment 😂😂😂 for those who didnt get it, the comment meant that the views were halved because of the snap
Ronnie Jusan exactly! Thanks ❤️❤️❤️😅
 @babypatrick553  I also understood your comment and gave a funny reply. 🧐🤨
You mean the infinity war was more beautifull than endgame
I agree with you 👍👍👍👍
 @lsutosplays2779    endgame is masterpiece movie than infinity war
 @pritamchavan1070  Endgame is 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
 @lsutosplays2779  still decoding your comment
 @pritamchavan1070  infinity war is best
SeverusPlays lets respect each other’s opinions! 😀😀😀
 @maz3rlaz3r15  this trailer got 200 million views in one week. It won
It's not a conclusion... For views and likes
Maybe because of confusing title
 @07rohit07  title isn't confusing. What do you mean?
 @DivvayKhatri  see the first trailer's name it's only Avengers and not Avengers endgame
I like infinity war better, but didn’t endgame basically make twice as much?
dude half the universe was gone when Endgame dropped. Thanos
The funniest moments from Avenger Infinity War on my channel.
 @babypatrick553  no thxs
@CincoMitzi Not even close to twice at much, more like 1.3 times as much.
Thanos just wiped half of the viewers out of existence.
People really didn't wanted any spoilers bout the movie so most of them didn't watch it
Lmao
The original views for endgame trailer was 280+
Wrong ppl don’t want to be spoiled
Yeah but endgame became the highest grossing film of all time
The hype for infinity war was disgusting it had like a 100m views in 24 hours
avery baxter idk if disgusting is the word here
It's increasing.
 @ronayusan4047  😅
Thanos snaped to dust half of all living creatures
It really happen.
The hype for endgame boosted this trailer
Well thanos did nerf the views
Thanos snap
115+115=230 hmmmmm..... 🤔🤔🤔
Infiniti war>Endgame
yeah because infinity war was way better
iiVirgilPlayz perfectly balanced! As all things should be!
Sera porque infinity war a sido mas esperada que endgame
Infinity war and endgame are both good.
Endgame trailer after the hulk snap:230 mil views
Can't lie avengers endgame lowkey sucked tho
there were both epic but I give the edge to Infinity War.  Everyone coming together and having Thanos win gave us a marvel movie like no other.
Nahh Man......Its Less Because People Are Scared Of Spoilers 


I For One Didn't See Any Trailers....Only Teasers
That's because Infinity War is better than Endgame.
Perfectly balanced...
iiVirgilPlayz see I think we all fought avenger infinity war was the last but nope.
50% gone
Its 232 now
Bcoz Infinity War > Endgame
The views were decimated lol
Maz3rLaz3r do you get ye joke
Infinity War=$2,048,359,754
Endgame=$2,797,800,564
Because Endgame sucks and Infinity War is god tier
teranyan Avengers Emdgame was not announced so there was no hype around it.
No
Not really.. Endgame gross $2.8 billion and infinity war $2.2 billion
Infinity war is better 🚫🧢
 @tpaprince9856  280 million views really give me the link trailer and wiki for that
 @202nicenlong  no infinity war has 2,048 Billion and when will the 2,8 Billion in box office updated and if endgame had no very strong competition it would easily make 3 Billion or
Infinity war was better
Ice Bear it’s at 130 now so
Infinity war was better than endgame
Cause infinity war is raging fire🔥
Endgame is smoldering fire
Infinity war - $ 2.09 billion 
Endgame - $ 2.8 billion dollars.
Infinity War Was Hype
Endgame Was Serious
Infinity war was better that’s why
Wonder why its half the Views 🤔
 @BCuniverse-ce4ih  agreed
The movies were equally hyped, but this trailer is a whole different breed of awesome
Who cares about that they made billions and more than last part
I personally watched this trailer like 1000 times..
i think some people who replied your comment did not get your point😕 they comparing both movies lol .you are right 50% of the population had been gone after infinity war so thats why views are halved in the endgame trailar
 @JaspreetSingh-dn8bz  bro what about end game earned more than infinity views ki baat ne hoti paisa
steve smith bro he is talking about thanos ‘s snap not about money 💰 snap ke karan 50%people mar gye the es liye trailar ke views half hain endgame ke
 @JaspreetSingh-dn8bz  bro marne se kya hota hai film hai mtlb agar mr gye to logo ne last part dekhna chod diya kya aur endgame ne to zyaada paise kmaye tha
steve smith abey pagal hai kya ,its imagination only . paise ki to baat hi nhi ho rahi.we are not talking about box office collection and not comparing movies. ab tere ko kon samjaye ke thanos ki snap ki imagination ho rahi hai
 @locutus1126  it gave excitement what will happen in the next part
Because peoples were so hyped and they directly watched endgame without its trailer.
Half of the population has been snaped
It's becuase the endgame trailer was out 11 days ago and infinity was 5 months ago.
Especially when Disney over hyped endgame lmao
Good film however could have been much better
KGF 
Coming soon ❤️🔥
Lol now Kgf tisear 2 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳✔️  1day-75M
wait for kgf 2 teaser to break both the records .

Endgame became the highest grossing film in the world 🤷‍♂️

mueed adnan but if u refresh the video instead of replaying it you get your view counted again
He's right you have to refresh the page in order to get another view.
There are several videos that have more views than that.
+Razzashazza But have you seen movie trailers that have more views than this?
Razzashazza IW trailer broke record the most view in 24 hours, the most view movie trailer e 100M views within 2 weeks, even force awakens trailer the most view trailer before only reach almost 100M in 2 years, this is example how people so exciting about this movie

All these "surprise" from "Marvel Entertainment" are most likely fake, don't think the real Marvel would give real free gift card codes.

Not in the new 52 of dc
Expect universe 10 and  9
Who cares  maybes there’s real superheroes out there earthlings don’t know about. LOL
HANNAN SALIS Yes there is a real multiverse
Emmett McGourty wow.....
Its actually like 300 million but the counter is slow
B.I.O We’re talking official YouTube upload, not overall distribution.
If this trailer hit 100 million views it will be the first trailer on YouTube who got so many views.
Night King infinity war still need to surpass force awaken trailer views
Conqueror We need to surpass Star Wars and give PUNCH to DC
The Hope is getting real..imagine the madness when the Avengers 4 trailer drops next year
Tiger Zinda Hai, 50 million views and nearly 1 million likes, only from India only in 3 weeks. Power of Salman Khan. Khan vs entire might of Hollywood together.
Where is China when u need them.
Aarif0001 bollywood sucks. Go watch some good movies
comics-movie studios, cmom be a sport. Bollywood makes good movies at the fraction of the cost as compared to these useless monsters produced by Hollywood.....Khan is a superstar and has been voted sexiest man on earth, many a times.
Cause I have been waiting Thanos for years
Night King minions is the most watched trailer on YT with 120 million views.
Amar Amir it stil needs to beat sing
Amar Amir wich has 132 million
The Marvel Lover its actually sing
Conqueror force awakens trailer has 99 million
I know, this is so crazy. Marvel completely rocks it
Emmett McGourty which is sad because Ultron trailer was better than this. Age of Ultron was a flop of a movie for the simple fact they made it too easy to beat him and that they actually did beat him, if they wanted to they could've done an infinity war type 2 part deal with Ultron and make him slightly less quippy and more unfeeling and merciless like they displayed in the trailer.
Think nobody was interested in age Ultron
to bring together a group of remarkable people...
To see if we could become something more
So when we needed them they could write our homework
That we never could.
In time...
You will know what it's like to pass.
To feel so desperately that you'll pass, yet to fail all the same.
Dread it...
Run from it...

Waiting for new Avengers 4 trailer
Who Waiting For Avengers 4 Trailer?
a DECADE of MARVEL CINEMATIC UNIVERSE ... andddd BOOOOOOM!!!
This was five years ago. If you are still watching this trailer after that long, you are a legend.

(I change the amount of years every year to stay caught up)
Best movie ever made in Marvel movies
I watch this like 4-5 times a week just cause
How do you guys plan on beating them? 

Together.

We’ll lose.

Then we’ll do that together too.
“Where’s Hawkeye?”
“He’s busy playing tag. It’s very important for him, so don’t worry.”
i remember watching this trailer for the first time in my gym while running on treadmil
Right, gonna go rewatch
Rocket: What happened to your brother?
Thor: Strangled to death
Rocket: Mother?
Thor: Killed by a Darkelf
Rocket: Best friend?
Thor: Stabbed in the heart
Captain America: I can do this all day
0:32 that music intro 🔥
"Dread it , Run from it"...movie aside who loves the trailer equally?(like me)
the Avengers lost this battle because they didn't stop Thanos together like what they did to Ultron. 
Stark: "Like the old man said, "TOGETHER"."
2:00 Look at Hulk 🥲 They gave us hope for nothing
When Does This Realese It Looks SO GOOD
Im addicted to this
I love it
Bring Back That Classical Mcu ❤😢
I had hoped Red Skull would be one of Thanos's children but it's not looking like we'll see Red Skull again, at least not for awhile 👍
😁
Ozen The Immovable lmao good one
SpaceMonkey Gaming that would've been a good twist
Wow
Dread it Run from it Comedy still arrives
Just like loki heh?
Looool
《Budokai Elite》2017 If only he survived
Red skull might be tied in with avengers 4 because captain marvel eill be in it AFTER her debut in a solo film whrre they explain the skrull kree war era. Red skull will be involved
+The Matrix Uploaded Very true because there has been been Marvel villains that have been disrespected over the years. Cross Bones, Loki(Thor Ragnorok) because he was not menacing and conniving like he was in the first 2 Thor films and Avengers 1. Now Thanos CGI looks trash and nothing like the Thanos we've seen in the end credit scenes he's appeared in.
I think Loki was fine in Ragnarök and they wanted Thor to outshine Loki this time unlike in the previous movies
+The Matrix Uploaded I hope so because we've been waiting for years to see Thanos and this is the shit version they give us. Not good at all and he doesn't look intimidating at all.
+Jmgjgdjd5 Loki is supposed to be one of Marvels best villains and they completely turned him into a joke as of late.
MRTUPAC28 he already was one, he was defeated comedically in Avengers
I saw a theory where red was thanos and space might have changed him
《Budokai Elite》2017 yes
who is red? and why is he Thanos?
Jmgjgdjd5 Captain America's Villian in The First Avenger
that's Red Skull
Yup he will be half bored to death half trying to work out how to stand up
music edits lmfao he prolly not even gone remember what legs are
are you talking about Thanos or Red Skull?
MRTUPAC28 just the lighting but he still looks sickkk
Same
The Batman LOL 😂😂 the batman is waiting for the avengers!!! We need this type of unity between the marvel and dc fans
It’s because dc hasn’t released my new movie THE BATMAN so I like marvel
Its not gonna come out until the second Cpt. Marvel trailer is out, so tbh, expect about January/February 2019 tbh
Avengers 4 trailer comes out in November last

Adriane Gillyard what’s the point in asking then?
Mujhe lag rha Hai ki avengers infinity war ki tarah avengers 4 ka bhi trailer November me aye GA
this is the new one. notice the Hulk in the last scene? Dr Strange used his magic. (or Marvel made a mistake with the trailer, either way I love this trailer)
Lets get this comment to 400K so marvel can see it

Sir Nuts Of Deez it's joke? 😂
Max Terez no, I think Infinity War is overrated.
U dont want Avengers 4????? THE ENDING? Or infinty war
Agreed
hell nah winter soldier is miles better, infinity war is overrated
Ismokeloud 75 Avengers 4 is supposed to be the best film ever made😁
Infinity could shit itself and still be three times better than winter soldier
I believe the best marvel movie is Logan
Sam Roberts nice
Aman Jain 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 that's a pretty funny joke man.
Timaraspro Gaming Channel agreed
One of the best movies. It’s not the only one. But defiantly the best in the MCU in my opinion. Can’t wait for avengers 4

"Steve.."
Together divided by 2 😐
Sonny Aquino just call goku and vegeta
Sick age of Ultron reference
Wow,  thats really deep.   who wrote that?  a 5 year old?
but they didnt.lose together stark was left on titan while.steve in wakanda
Harry Carrey Tony Stark with Steve in Age of ultron
Sonny Aquino is what movie was that quote from? I don’t believe it was this one but I can’t recall.
King Josiah Age of ultron
Bolt Marksman I was thinking the same thing
Infinity War must have taken place during the month of May..
I thought the producers were like most of the movies take place around the time they're released except for a select few so I could see that
Lol the movie
He will be in infinity war 2
He’ll come back and tag Thanos right at midnight of the 31st of May, no greater shame in the world.
He was under house arrest
Bolt Marksman he's dead😟😞
I guess he went waterskiing with his kids
Bolt Marksman nope Hawkeye got tag up by green arrow!
Kiwi intro maker with arrow mask on him....
 @ambera4525  since when? He was under house arrest. Are you making that up?
James H. I said he's dead
James H remember when Thanos cracked his neck i said nothing about house arrest
Operation can't touch this
WHERE'S ALL THE OTHER MARVEL CHARACTERS AT?
THE X-MEN, MAGNETO, OTHER MUTANTS SUCH AS SCARLET WITCH?
😂
Hawkeye is trying to beat his best golf score.
musta felt good
Weak hero
Who’s Thor’s best friend
 @hydrix9430  Heimdall
Markie Bawalan, it was because of Civil War they lost.... it divided them...
Markie Bawalan they lost because of Loki being Loki, it's all his fault.
TurtleLover 28 nope
plvtoisaplanet it's his fault, he should of left the stone on asgard to be destroyed. He could of prevented all of the events in Infinity War.
i see thanos defeat by thor
Rue Not posible, the Stone can teleportate things and Thanos, also he feels It's power when he gets it
Markie Bawalan well then again if starlord hadn't attacked out of nowhere they'd most likely have had gotten off the gauntlet
If you watched the movie Dr strange and spidy got beamed up and iron Man went to rescue them, after killing Squidward, the ship lead them to titan, and nebula told mantis to meet them at titan too.
Bork351 lol the irony
Markie Bawalan they lost because they could't beat thanos. He had the INFINITY GAUNTLET: he could do whatever he wanted. Thanos was too strong also for any god in the MCU, so... let's see Avengers 4 and how Avengers will manage this terrible plight
Markie Bawalan that's exactly what i said
TurtleLover 28 it’s not really fair to place entire blame on Starlord. Tony could easily left when Docter Strange told him to
Mier Garz so have Tony and Wanda throw in Nebula as well. Strange told Stark to run once they got time stone back. Wanda could have killed Vision when he asked. Nebula gotten caught which lead to Gamora telling Thanos where the location to the soul stone was at
there was no way they could've won
Actually they did win. Look at those paychecks
But this is not fair 1 man vs the whole avangers
Markie Bawalan True
They lost the battle...


So they could win the war.
I really like star Lord but the truth is they failed only because him
There’s plenty of blame to go around
i know right
Markie Bawalan Thank you Professor Stan Lee!

Most people don't understand what INFINITY WAR is about.

It's so sad but true.

Thanos loved the most!  And that's why he suffered the greatest!  He wanted to give the woman he loved, Gamora, the most valuable items the universe had to give...THE INFINITY STONES.  (DIAMINDS, EMERALDS, RUBIES ect - THE MINERALS FROM THE EARTH THAT WE GIVE SO MUCH VALUE TO...The stones have been attributed as being more valuable than human lives). The same way men murder, enslaved, and suffer slave bondage to give to the ones they love!  Ie..their wife, mother, loved one.  

Infinity War is a masterpiece!  So much so that I believe it is way ahead of it's time!   OMG. TIME.  

TIME.  THAT IS GODS GREATEST GIFT.
Mier Garz everyone lost!  Including Thanos.  Thanos lives in a self created prison with the love of his life.  He doesn't have the real thing, Gamora.
Uh no they lost because thanos was just too powerful for them to stop
TurtleLover 28 i hate people who bag starlord for that. It suits his character and thats all people should want from a movie. And doctor strange said that it was the only way. So starlord had to do it. But no one cares that doctor strange literally handed an infinity stone to him. And all because hes the one who said it had to be done
Raven no they didnt it had to be done because thats what dr strange said. And i see you hating on starlord. Y not hate on dr strange since he literally handed an infinity stone to thanos. And no one cares because strange said it was the only way
Maxamed Ali me to
Me too
Maxamed Ali ME TO
I'm straight up listening to this at the gym over and over instead of music.

The best part of the trailer was iron spider for sure
I don't know what to do with my life anymore.. avengers ...😪
Rip Chadwick boseman gem of marvel ❤🎉

BUMMMMMMM!!!!! bum bummmm BUM BUMMMM! BUM. BUM. BUM.

I watch this movie as my first Marvel movie then I have to watch all previous movies, the Marvel effect
Thor: BRING ME THANOS


tchala: get this man a thanos
5 years ago dam thats half a decade 
This movie came out thats mad
Why is T'Challas voice so cool
What a movie 😮😮
LEGEND !
"There can't be a friendly neighborhood spider-man if there's no neighborhood"
5 years ago this is number 1 marvel best movie
Civilized Delinquent not a problem for them lmao
Civilized Delinquent pirates of the Caribbean Stranger Tides cost 1 billion...
I'm pretty sure they will make a big profit on this..unlike DC and Justice League.
Pirates 4 cost 250-300 million and made 1 billion in box office.
Exicuate Exide it made 1 billion not cost
Civilized Delinquent that’s exactly what I said😂
Pirates 4 cost $378.5 million dollars not including tax.
Ha ha ha..

Joke's on you....
All the actors, and crews did this movie for free...
And they made their own costumes...
Shot it with someone's iPhone....
And used Snapchat filters for special effects....

Budget was only a dollar....
Exicuate Exide Are you high lmao. It was 300 million
you really don't think Infinity War will make over 1 billion? The first Avengers film made over 1.5 billion, and this movie is way more anticipated than that one. They'll make 1 billion easily.
Imaginivity Multiverse Horizons It's pretty obvious they knew that, they just don't care.
Hulk was in the movie at the beginning
DHRUV'S TEC&HEX , have you even watched the movie? He was in the beginning
lmaooo
*Shown Hulk in Wakanda but wasn't in movie
😢
Vignesh Rachha 
THANK YOU
Vignesh Rachha gtfo. This movie got me in my feels
The next generation looks boring af especially because Craptain Marvel will be the leader
Watch spiderman far from home and wait for after credit scene. You'll probably hope for something again in your life..
shanzooö _- like and conment
Cheer up buddy. They'll probably have a X-Men reboot.
 @andrewaybar3111  dude...trust me...I am as big a fan as you...I have literally travelled more than 30 miles to watch this movie....absolutely loved it.
 @lordtourette6057  yeah, Thanos get the power stone and punch her in the face, she just go down instantly! She is powerfull but i expect more! 
I'll remember Thanos! 100% the best villain!
 @lordtourette6057  who knew whether MCU will fail or get  success and everyone knows what it got so captain marvel will also be a successful leader
Tony Stark's snapped wiped out all the immediate threats but apparently, not the morons...
 @piyushjain9913  Captain Marvel is not a good character. She is also a terrible person in real life
Starpotatoes and it got 1M likes which is the first marvel movie to reach that.
I know right its getting about 1.9 million views per hour
Starpotatoes that’s marvel loyalty for you there!’
14.5 hours... Lol
I’m honestly impressed
Population is growing so fast now days
rahul gautam 
lool Youtube is not there in China
F8CK YEAH!!! WHOHOOOOOOO AVENGERS>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> JUSTICE League
Infinity War trailer is the first film trailer to reach 1M likes, that too in under 4 hours
Frank Castle no indian film mersal has already done it
Well yeah. People want to see epic light saber battles. Not that last trash was.
TNT Gaming i think the like button is broken or something because there was 767.000 likes and the vieuws where 486.000 soww probally this video have already 3 million likes
Thats you can understand fan following of iron man
Starpotatoes now 34 million
The reason probably many people put it on the loop because its just too awesome you cannot watch it ONCE only
BobertSolomon me too

BobertSolomon ICONIC

 @Anonymous-mj3wg  he misspelled the name.
 @youngbainthin5193  He didn't ...
 @Anonymous-mj3wg  it’s spelled T’Challa. Everyone knows that bro
 @youngbainthin5193  kk ....my bad 😌
Just Because it is
Just be quiet and get this man a shield!!! I heard that Baku of the Jabri is in this movie too! Which im hyped! He was awesome in Black Panther.
Never mind i just saw him in the end
Insane Pugz Ikr its amazing
It’s South Africa xhosa
Because he is de king, he knows da wey
engage all defenses
Worldbre4ker Oh, correction good sir! You may be thinking of M'Baku, known as Man-ape in the comics, however he was talking about T'Challa
Insane Pugz Evacuate the city
... omg when he says it my ears say thank you to me
I would go with the voice of Chris Hamsworth 😍who the hell are you guys👌
Rajneesh Grover Hackee because that meme isn't dead at all......😂
Did you forget his first name? It’s... shit,now I can’t remember
First Name Last Name I thought it was T'challa
Because he's black! And he's a panther
Insane Pugz 
Because it’s Chadwick Boseman
and there can`t be a friendly neighborhood spider-man if there is no spider-man
He aint wrong
You know you put quotes around it.
Quincintous your lack of quotes makes no sense if your quoting the movie.
And there cant be a neighborhood if there is no friendly..oh wait what?
This movie quotes are just...perfect...
Quincintous I'm a Marvel fan and what you said made no sense.
Quincintous Then why did you say "well that makes no sense"?
Quincintous lmao. Yup ur definitely a 12 yr old
Quincintous That's not what he said though.
Quincintous lol he said " well OK, that doesnt really make any sense "
Ive watched the movie 10 times and if I have to question your comment it goes to show no one will understand you. You can't hear tone of voice on the internet. You need to be punctual and use quotations of you want to be understood. Also I don't think your in any position to tell people "how YouTube works" when you don't fully have a grasp on the english language itself. So "go and graduate " as you put it
Quincintous
"Cause I've learned English from Oxford university 😎"
Oxford must've lost their shit then, if that's the case.
Love you Avengers 💖😍
100 million.... we can do this...
You know its a famous cast when tom holland has about 3 seconds in the trailer lol
PEAK MARVEL

38m views and 1m likes and its not been 1 day yet
WTF Marvel....slow down a bit😂
If Wolverine was in it it would have a long time ago.
-___- why?
This does put a smile on my face.
if you count reaction videos .............its far more .............so hyped !!
Ryan DeKnoblough What?
Exactly what I said.  Think about how cool that would be.  Yes I'm a die hard Wolverine fan but if the Disney Fox deal goes through and they put him in it.  I would lose my shit and I know a lot of other people would to.
Ryan DeKnoblough but it be a different actor playing him....i think tom hardy is lined up to do it
Of course some people won't be happy about it because it would water down characters like Deadpool. I do not want to see a PG 13 Deadpool.
It will most definitely be a different actor playing him.  I wouldn't mind if they cast an unknown actor.  Maybe shorter like the ones from the comics and wearing finally that classic and iconic costume.
I don't either.  Fox proved if done right you can make a ton of money doing a hard R superhero film.  Marvel can do it.  Will they?  Maybe not right now but I wouldn't bet against it.
Remember the violence in Deadpool is more for the comedic effect and Wolverine it is serious.  i'll say you probably already knew that.
If you are talking to me then I would say why the hell not?  I can make the argument Spiderman and Wolverine are by far the two most popular Marvel Superheroes we have.
Dan Garcia yes we can
c HB Nah Fam, Tom Hardy is playing Venom in a Venom movie that's coming in 2018 or 2019 I think.
go marvelllll
Go DC and Marvel.

0:54 how my skin is watching this trailer...
The best movie of all time in marvel is INFINITY WAR ❤ none of the movie can beat this
I remember the good old days when I was panicking  over 1:37 when in actuality I should have been more concerned about 1:39
💯💥
watching this trailer now feels like you had a child athlete at there peek in the zone easily winning the championship ,,,but that child immediately traded in there Olympic golds and got hooked on coke , abandoned the family, used the funds to keep there coke dealer a float until all the money and human connections withered away....but instead of coke its "THE MESSAGE" and we are the family wishing our kid would snap out of it

"Grandpa what's Avengers?"

"There was an idea..."
 @RetroMonkeyBizzz  That "Story for the grand kids" is actually really common so I don't know what you're trying to prove here.
"Sit down with me and I will tell you a story like none you have never heard before. One that spreads from one realm, one galaxy and one side of the universe to another. One where people are born great, achieve greatness and have greatness thrust upon them"
It was in the original script to have hulk in wakanda
Go for it...

There's a clue about Avengers 4 in this trailer. Anybody remember that scene right before the title was shown and Thor asks, who the hell are you guys? No? Right, it didn't happen in INFINITY WAR, but was probably shot for Avengers 4... 👀👀
We still waiting for avengers anihilation or last avenger or endgame or what ever

I dont get this joke
Audience laughed on this
Anmol Gupta 
Groot only says "I am Groot" with different meanings, which cap doesn't know so he just thought he was introducing himself sayin "I am Groot" 
So the logical response to him was to introduce himself as well "I am Steve Rogers"
Filip Milinkovic That was cute😂❤
What was funny when Thor Kept calling rocket 🚀 rabbit 🐇 lmao 😂
Filip Milinkovic that's the fun ie St bit
One of the funniest scenes : thor:let me meet you my friend the tree
Captain: 😐
We're Venom
The joke was better in french because the I am groot sentence doesn't make sense at all so Steve respond him with the same form of sentence but with his name.  hard to explain ...
Lmao
Dr. Strange: Who is your master?




Starlord: What am I supposed to say? Jesus?
The Snappening has happened
I am T'Challa. Son of T'Chaka. The King of Wakanda and the Black Panther.
Filip Milinkovic “BRING ME THANOS” - Thor
Filip Milinkovic no i am groot
@RamenNoodlz Gaming I laughed to that joke so much for some reason and I really don't know why. :D
+Anmol Gupta. it wasn't about it being a joke. It was a cute interaction between characters. And it was charming.
You are doctor and a magician
Iam spider and a man.😉😉
I’m peter by the way. Dr Strange. Oh we’re using our made up names- then I am spider man
Lol
Filip Milinkovic I
I am your father
I m groot 
Dad😫
I haven't seen the movie
Filip Milinkovic lol
Who saw the movie already
Filip Milinkovic i am INVOKER
Filip Milinkovic ii
Hahahaha i laughed so hard at this
lmao
I've gotta jar of dirt
I've gotta jar of dirt
spoiler alert!
Meet my friend, tree.
I can't believe rocket took that shit too, not like him at all.
Je s'appele Groot. Je s'appele Steve Rogers LOL
Filip Milinkovic I’m batman
Filip Milinkovic ⚡
Filip Milinkovic three epic moments in the whole movie 
1. Cap emerges from shadow.
2. When tony got stabbed, the whole theatre gasped including me. 
3. Thor's entry in wakanda.
Am I the only one that noticed that Rocket didn’t correct Thor for calling him a rabbit. I think it’s coz he never clicked so quickly with anyone like he did with Thor.
RamenNoodlz Gaming y
thetrollbasher ikr. Cap is such a gentlemen. And a cutie.
Filip Milinkovic lol I laughed in that moment in the movie
Anmol Gupta he didn't know Groot so he said I'm Steve Rogers because Groot only say I am Groot
I remember that part of the movie XD
It does doesn't it
Give this man a beer!
Good job.. you spoiled half of the movie
How? He was fat and drunk and playing fortnut
M M how did I spoil half the movie
 @MatthewGoggles  not really
If you don't want to get spoiled, stay off the Internet.
M M fortnut is not school appropriate
Hahahah😂👏
Lil Dairy How? Thor’s Fat In Endgame....  let people watch the movie for themselves.
John Wong ....”-“
Spoil??
Give this guy a gym membership ership😂
 @joshkang8258  "you know you can't eat dumbbells right?" - rocket
John Wong hows that hypocritical?
 @zanioxl3663  he said that the original commenter spoiled the movie, then revealed that fortnite was in Endgame...
When I’m done, half of this movie will be unspoiled
And a gym
M M how on earth is that a spoiler it’s like saying “oh cap has a new uniform” woah
Lil Dairy 

You: Unoriginal
Black Panther: Give this man a life
KryKry it’s not a spoiler
FriendlyKid Jayden what? Calm down
DestroyerMachine lol calm down it was just an original joke.... u mad?! 🤣
Give this man a laugh evacuate all the hate and give this man a like
Spoiler
Copied comment 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻😩😩😩👎🏻
Iron man goes o o f
Give this man a treadmill
You just spoiled the movie
Eliminate the beer boxes
Start a gym membership 
And get this man a salad
Lil Dairy iron man dies
Thor’s mum: He better eat that salad
 @MatthewGoggles  i want to play this non existent game called futnut
*Movie Spoiled...
Lil Dairy spoiler alert
Matthew Cantoran if you haven’t seen Endgame yet I don’t know what to tell you
Okay Let’s stop fighting I don’t wanna deal With NOOBMASTER69
All you will see is people complaining about spoilers haha
FriendlyKid Jayden, fortnut? I think the term your looking for is cancer.
Lil Dairy is a freaking spoiler
They honestly ruined Thor's character by doing that. They could have had a really interesting plot line by exploring his depression, and given him even more amazing character development, but instead they botched it and turned him into a joke. He went from being one of the best characters in the MCU to being a complete joke.
Not salad it's shield
kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk ;-;
KryKry Then why go to the comment section of course there's gonna be Endgame spoilers
lol
Nice




Like it
 @MatthewGoggles  don't worry that isn't in the movie
 @MatthewGoggles  fortshite
Lil Dairy spoiled avengers endgame
Lol
MTF I have ligma%
MTF yes I’m lookin for cancer
Stolen comment
kaimincraftgamer2890 kaiplays2 nope
CM Meena it’s salad
YelloTrout fat Thor is better
HAHAHA
Lil Dairy 😂😂😂 thank you for this comment. It made me laugh out loud
Nyah Ingram well oof,

Actually his mother told him to eat a salad in end game
 @shayan8181  true
🤣
TheBernadette7 calm down
YelloTrout calm down they made a good choice.
Me Me what about on newspapers
Actually I would have said "Get this man some keto"
While Loki becomes his personal trainer lol

Not a Yetti marvel has enough lol 

5000k for each movie
I mean 50000k
Pritam Kumar Patra 🖒
go go Capitan American and black panther!
i would like to point out to everyone that the A3 trailers are ABOMINABLY GENERIC. 

Nearly as yawn-worthy as the Last Jedi trailers. (We went from seeing Rey in a light sabre duel with Kylo in TFA... to her just waving it around as "training"? WHAT IDIOT thought that wouldn't be a letdown?)

"HEY! IT'S THOR'S BACK! Poorly lit!"

TELL ME I'M WRONG:

it begins with a GENERIC PLANET SHOT (smart directors NEVER do generic)... then next is RJDjr in ORDINARY CLOTHES, looking like he's taking a nap or weeping during his favorite Adele song... NEXT is a generic shot of Ruffalo in a post-hulk daze.... and NEXT is Ordinary Footage of Dr. Strange that just looks rehashed from his solo film... (you can't make this up!)... NEXT is... vision (?)... in the dark... opening curtains (brilliant, right?).... NEXT is an Ordinary, poorly-lit shot of ScarWitch...[DID RIAN JOHNSON MAKE THIS TRAILER???]....NEXT is an Ordinary shot of them both (with Vision looking like STING!) (save for the fact that we get to see the actor looking Ordinary -- minus his INTERESTING makeup ---  but with the stone in his head.....yawn).... NEXT is Thor's back (WHO thinks that's interesting????!!! is everyone just a lying liar?).... [EVEN THE VOICEOVERS SOUND LIKE RIAN WROTE THEM: "I see darkness.... light.... zzzzzzz"]....NEXT is an Ordinary shot of Ruffalo.... STANDING THERE.... (!!!)... NEXT is an Ordinary, boring shot of BWidow... just standing there (see any pattern yet?)...

....NEXT is the Marvel logo, which I'll never tire of seeing (cuz... ART!).... they could've JUST made the trailer that with the music! TEN SECONDS. Give us TOTAL MYSTERY about WTF we are about to go see! ....NEXT.... one of the MOST generic shots of Manhattan EVER (that shot has been used in a zillion tv shows and films!!!!!!!).... (thre's even a famous song about the 59th st bridge!) (cripes!)......NEXT is four of our heroes... STANDING AROUND... poorly lit .... NEXT is RDjr... OPENING AN ORDINARY DOOR (!!).... [HOW did anyone like this video?? am i losing my mind, cuz this is quantifiably bad!]....NEXT is Peter Parker's spideysense raising the hairs on his arm (THAT is interesting and something we've never seen before).....NEXT is a generic shot of Spaceship-Over-NYC... and then a BORING and Ordinary reaction shot of Peter... LOOKING (zzzz!)......NEXT are a few GENERIC shots of Big City Destruction.... [I bet the guy who made this trailer -I'm guessing it was NOT the Russos - is angry he couldn't insert a shot of the Golden Gate Bridge being torn apart!] ..... NEXT is a generic shot of Mr. Mullet, Loki, holding the Tesserac (zzzz) (it's only interesting b/c we wonder if he's handing it over to Bruce Willis, er, Thanos...) (wait.. i thought CABLE was Playing Thanos...) (gotta keep stuff as repetitious as possible, Marvel and Fox!).... NEXT is THE worst shot in the history of CBMs.... (NO ONE at Marvel thought Thanos MINUS HELMET looked 120% like Bruce Willis?? SERIOUSLY??) (did NONE of them see the TINY Apocalypse and learn any lesson????)....NEXT is the Iron Spider costume by Iron Man... which IS something we've never seen before, so congrats on that.....

 
.....NEXT....are some dull generic scenes.... and then BPanther's (too-forced) "someone get that man a Shield" (corny IMO)....then we see a poorly-lit and ORDINARY shot of Steve Rogers (whoa he's got a beard!! That's INCREDIBLE!!!!).....NEXT a generic shot of SW... NEXT a generic we've-already-seen-it Hulkbuster Iron Man suit.... then BW scrunching her face (!!!).... then MORE REUSED SHOTS FROM DR STRANGE's solo film (!!!)..... and the rest of the trailer is MORE GENERIC SUPERHERO FOOTAGE we've seen umpteen times!

(It even has the SAME running-all-together juvenilia we had in Avengers and A2 and Civil War! OOOOF!)

(NOTE: I LOVE the Russo Brothers, but who greenlit this super-GENERIC trailer? Better to give us NO footage than GENERIC footage.)

IT ENDS WITH ONE OF THE MOST PAINFUL SHOTS I'VE EVER SEEN IN MOVIE HISTORY:

Thor's line is okay, but then it cuts to a super-awkward CONTRIVED shot... where Pratt looks like he's sucking a lozenge and smirking WHILE THE CAMERAS ARE NOT ROLLING (but they are!)... and then Mantis' AWKWARDLY-contrived wave (also looking like they shot that scene to NOT be in the film -- a fan teaser most likely ---  so no one cared how poorly it cameout) (WHO thinks that's better than just having Teen Groot say "i am groot"???????!!!!) (THOR SET IT UP FLAWLESSLY for Groot's line!!!!!) instead we get MUTE Rocky (!!!)... MUTE Groot (!!!).... and MUTE Mr. Talkative? CONTRIVED, FORCED, and impossibly bad.

(nearly as missed an opportunity as all of Rian's, like NO FIGHT tween good BB-8 and EVIL BB-8??? HOW did you not do that?? We never saw R2 or 3P0 kick ass!) (or the idea to NOT have R2 or 3P0 fly the ship at lightspeed instead of Dern -- -WHO would've seen the death of 3P0 or R2 coming? NO ONE!!! %$#@!@!!!!) (Better to create Holdo and Rose INSTEAD of having Chewie or the droids fill those spots?!?!) 

I WAS HOPING the internet was making everyone more honest, but everyone still goes along with GroupThink on clear garbage like this. (Plus humans want to believe in positive thoughts as a coping mechanism.)

I was SO happy to see consumers revolt on TLJ (dumbest blockbuster EVER) --- TRUTH won! 

I expect A3 to be very interesting and innovative... but this TRAILER is pure trash.
will this be the last avengersS?
Empire Goodness This guy would be great at cinemasins
Yes
How come I'm only hearing about this movie now?
At this point, this trailer should be trending #1 in the entire universe Galaxy
Pritam Kumar Patra i

Richard Gamer good

panda gaming not all :/
panda gaming no wolverine:/
NO DAREDEVIL
What! What! Happened!!!
Simon Andersson Wolverine were different universe, XMen
Ahmad Aryanto Netflix series are too bad to be on here lol
X-men is coming after Avengers 4 chill
Rahmadikka Akbar ik tho i wish he would have been in this movie
Say that to Jessica Jones and Luke Cage , even BW and hawkeye are more useless compared to them XDD
Ch Jo X-Men isn't part of this universe
Ch Jo they can't just add X-Men tho cuz X-Men world is completely different from avengers they would need to add tons of mutants in the avengers universe for that to work
Ch Jo would be great if they did but unfortunately it won't ever happen cuz then they would have to explain where are all the mutants during all the avengers captain America Thor hulk iron movies etc
Ch Jo I would bet u $10000 they won't ever come together X-Men universe is full of mutants and war against mutants they cant just one day make a movie of avenger where suddenly there's mutants all over the place
Ch Jo if anything marvel is tryna add inhumans to the picture not X-Men
Ch Jo scarlet witch and quick silver where a acception cuz they are part of avengers franchise but in avengers universe they aren't even mutants and avengers didn't really have rights to quick silver that's why they killed him
Ch Jo but magneto dont exist in avengers world
Ch Jo but yuh the inhumans would be dope af
Ch Jo but inhumans are already confirmed I mean ms marvel is getting a movie then joining avengers
No when the x men show in they X Suit boy it's gonna be epic cause of avengers v x men
X men are not here
papi savage Disney just bought X-men, Fantastic Four, and Deadpool so this conversation is.... Over now. Xmen VS Avengers is gonna happen and people here will deal with it whether they like it or not.
Not 'ALL".....X-men aren't here, who are the official members of Avengers.
papi savage u
That time marvel was on another level..

Vijay wakle get
Steve Rogers is Groot?
Cos I am batman
🕋🌍ในการ
ยช
no
does anyone explains that line for me? I haven't seen any guardians movie so far, but I'm curious about that groot line is all about....
another good part is when they kept saying I'll do you one better lol
Luis Molina It’s all he can say, but it means different things. Rocket can understand everything Groot’s saying. For example, one time he said “I am Groot” it translated as “Welcome to the frickin Guardians of the Galaxy” only he didn’t use frickin. Another time it translated as “You think someone has a weird shaped head and then you realize part of that head is a hat.” I am Groot! = If you haven’t seen both Guardians of the Galaxy movies, you’re missing out!
I’ll do you one better. Why is Groot?
Really guys you are not ready
For the ending you are not read
Dat ending tho. 

Killed me. Like. Shit. I'm dead. Think I'm dead. Pretty sure I'm dead.
Can't believe half of everyone died... oops spoiler alert.
They are not going to see Grouts revenue stream just disappear and  fade into dust and ash , right ???
I hope not
____ dies
turin turambar people just do 't need to scroll down the comments under the trailer so YE w d I was died to caus I hated the ending so much
I wasn’t ready..
Alessandro Saar there's no Hulk in the movie
the OBSCURE 

Does Cap live ?
i wasnt ready
Swagtastic Gaming - Minecraft & More yeah... Sorry to anyone else if that's kinda a spoiler...
This movie is no joke... Good luck.
Saw it last night, I was sobbing
I saw it as well and you're right. Nobody is ready
Alessandro Saar I saw it too. I am official Dead.
I agree
Abhishek Yadav bro actually most of the country they realised today for India it is tommrow
Watched it......... I'll say all the people who died....



Spiderman  black panther  Groot Loki  Heimdal  vision  doc strange scarlet  witch  Bucky  falcon         star lord gamora drax  mantis

Yeah....
Released Yesterday But gonna watch it tomorrow
Can't wait! I'm going to see it Saturday
Spiderman dies
Yes
Mr. ToothPaste wait did all those people actually die or are you just lying
No it's true haven't u watched it yet?
its today!
Dread it... run from it... destiny still arrives
Yeah
Much respect to iron man for taking on thanos all by himself 💪
Monica child I think they just disappear. Maybe when shuri try to extract the mind stone and it did not finish the whole process something’s happen. I saw her taking the mind stone in the projector and she said if her works did not complete the process something will happen. And half of avenger slowly disappear after all how come all mutant/alien will die but human won’t. I bet they just go somewhere we don’t know and in the next movie someone will bring them back or maybe shuri will complete the process as vision body still there
Abhishek Yadav so you're going to bootleg the movie
I'm gonna watch in 4 hours 
(I live in Brazil)
30 mins
tonight
Black Panther definitely wont die hes a new superhero and is going to get a sequel and spiderman cant die they just fuckin rebotted him
lol no they're art of the deaths thanos wipes out by snapping his fingers, half the universe dies. But obviously new characters so deaths will mean nothing Disney want the sequel money of course deaths will be fixed by avengers 4
Throthgar Son Of Bothvar Well. Star Lord Dies? Meh. GOTG 3.
I lIkE ChIkCaNe
stellvia hoenheim Thanks?
+One Love half of human disappeared😂😂
jose magana can’t wait 😊
but is it made by activision?
nice, here, have a cookie bozo :P
Give us*
IT PREMIERES MONDAY AND THE CAPTAIN MARVEL TRAILER PREMIERES WENSDAY
It will drop on Monday as new reports say.
 @moviesnow1980  is it confirmed
 @moviesnow1980  It's illogical that Avengers' trailer will debut before Captain Marvel's. It first has to be Captain Marvel, as its premiere is two months prior to Avengers.
 @agiverreviga4592  it will be the second trailer to captain marvel, the first one is already out
Osman Avcı too right
 @pup2759  Silly me, I completely forgot lol then yeah, it's possible that Monday could be the release date for Avengers, but we've heard rumours for the date numerous times so I won't be surprised if it ends up being another rumour
Releasing tomorrow
Agiver Reviga but the first trailer already premiered
Agiver Reviga Well Marvel confirmed that it will be released before December 6th, so Monday seems pretty plausible. Plus just that day there is football game, and marvel premiered avengers 3 during a football game break
Probably coming out tommorow
Movies Now it has been changed Avengers 4 trailer on Wednesday and Captain Marvel on Monday.
 @agiverreviga4592  Actually they changed it. Captain Marvel is tomorrow and A4 is Wednesday during Good Morning America.
Movies Now other way around
Movies Now no silly Avengers 4 dropping Wednesday
Wednesday!
665 laik!!!!
Galaxy Hunter no
Can't wait for Wednesday ! Hype is real
Its going to release on Wednesday
 @moviesnow1980  correction, Captain Marvel premieres tom. and A4 trailer on Wed.(Thurs. Morning in the Philippines😁)
I don’t think people give two shits about captain marvel in all honesty it’s not gonna be as good as Wonder Women so just give us the A4 trailer please.
 @moviesnow1980  today? Because it's not here.
Dropping wendsesday
 @moviesnow1980  lol
It will come on Wednesday
The Captain Marvel trailer will come at Monday that is today
Fans:avengers 4
Marvel: captain marvel
Turkey
Vay mk
Vay türkiyelinin yorumu tutmuş
Come on marvel give us.
Anurag you were incorrect
Yeet now its on Friday
Friday
i think the last scene in this trailer is from avenger 4
bayu khalifa I don’t think so, black panther, bucky, and Sam have already been vanished...
 @kevinnn3460  in the avenger infinty war bruce not became hulk until he vanished, and that scene not came out on avenger infinity war. i don't know, it just my opinion.
 @moviesnow1980  Its the other way around m8
Friday morning
Osman Avcı The Time Police are on the way
Here it is just search it up and there it is
I am from the future it is end game
Oh, so you didn't watch the trailer
5 more days in vietnam :)
I'm going to see it on my bday the 28th!! Super hyped :)))
HELL YEAH
6 more!
5 more for me
The Max 4 days for me yeah boi
4 days Australia :)
4 days in UAE
The Max 6  MORE DAYS
The Max WOOT
4 DIASSSSSS
6 more days
3 days nuggets
Stoned Jiren 1 more day for me 








Jk I wish :(
3 more days in indonesia becuase indonesia release 25 april
why
Less then a god damn week. This is the first movie I’ve had so many dreams about. And I don’t even mean to dream about it
3 days for indonesia :D
5 days left for Malaysia
we are done watching it from screening. I can say It's good but not the best. The hype is not what i am expecting but it is not bad, thanos didn't get killed but got prison without infinity gauntlet. The extra scene at the end is all about galactus. Galactus knew what thanos did and I think he will come to earth
I came here at Thanos' request through that portal to make this trailer.  I am the space infinity stone.
Tuesday for my country, but gonna watch on thursday, perhaps
3more days In Finland
Going seeing it the day it comes out😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀
In the end I do not know why it said may 2018 it’s April
What drugs are you guys on it will release in 6 to 10 days all around the wirld
Laser Turtle 5 days around the world, but there are some places that do get it early for there 27th because of time zones in guessin
Now 5 days:)
5 more days!
2 more for me 😋
The Max 4 days 4 hours 1 minute
5 😱😍
5 more days now!!!!
Merry Christmas everyone 💜😘😍
The reason why Infinity War earned just 2.1 billion Dollar is because thanos wiped out half of the populatuon of the universe so only half of the populatuon of Earth watched Infinity War . That's the why Avatar , Endgame , Titanic are above in the highest grossing list 😮
best trailer ever
150,000,000!!!!!
Black Panther: Evacuate the city. Engage our defenses.

Emmet Brickowski: AND GET ME SOME GLITTER GLUE!!!
Cant believe its 5 years
every single day one more million views more
Who else is still watching this trailer 😅😊
Where was drax in the movie?
Most Viewed Marvel Video ❤🔥
Time when world was bit better..
Who's here before release?
We need to Captain America&Iron Man again!
i am wonder how hulk is in real form in the end
We grew up after this movie i guess :(
This was peak mcu
good job
Imagine if YRF make such kind of a Pan Indian movie!!!!
This was the last good one 😢
I was hooked the day this trailer was released.
you belive this world have santacros?
Bobby Grewal o uh
Bobby Grewal it's a movie not a Christmas Carol
Corcoba been waiting for this
First time I've ever seen a movie trailer get so many views wow! This is going to be such an epic movie <3...
Corcoban Advance Next milestone: 200million
Can we just get trailer 2 now
Nick Vollaro we can get it today through friday or we might just not get one. But rumors are ticket sales are going on friday and that is 6 weeks away from april 27. Ususaly ticket sales go on 6 weeks away just like black panther
Endangered Mexican All i want is that trailer but I'll take ticket sales to
Nick Vollaro I'm greedy I want both
Corcoban Advance  SHHHHIIIIITTTTT......ZZZZZZ
My thoughts was right about 150M after two months ago. It's growing better.
corcoban advance hopefully that will translate to this films box office making it to the 2 billion mark as this film deserves it far more than other 2 bill movies like force awakens and jurassic world as they didn't establish a cinematic universe that's lasted a decade that's never been done before they just were successful because of nostalgia the films themselves were crap
 @ROB86269  it did it
This has 119 million views at  21/01/18
Still not enough to beat Despacito's views, unfortunately. :(
waht the hell is that?
SVGLNR a trailer will not beat that view record on youtube
How many views does that have?
Timothy Haas just under 5 billion.
This is almost the most popular trailer on YouTube. (Infinity war, not despacito lol.) 
The current most popular is Minions, with roughly 120 million.
Egg Benedict WTF?
We will beat it no doubt.
Only 400,000 more to go.
I will keep watching this.
119,557,671 views so far.
Alan McCoy now we have more : )
Wont be long til we 120 million views
Harold Reiner very true
We did it!
Egg Benedict Sing trailer currently has 132M views
2 MILION.
Egg Benedict avengers infinity war trailer had 120 million views
We will soon beat that too.
The Man!! 22 million more in 32 days

Lmao same, I repeatedly watched it every day until the movie came out because I was super hyped to see Infinity War.
But still, why no hulk??
I miss this
love u iron man
I feel like the introduction of the multiverse was too early for the franchise
Theres nothing different aftre 5 years...
Infinity war was the MCU's peak, change my mind.
Never forget❤
Peak MCU
OMG it’s already been 5 years🤭
this is the last best Marvel film for me
I feel like avengers endgame was when marvel then peeked but after other than Spiderman far from home and no way home it just fell
Special features 😮❤
STILL CRAZY
5 years since the snap today
I always feel the disappointed about seeing Hulk in thumbnail😢
Here after 5 years!
Truth be told Thanos or the infinity stones can't touch the Quantum Realm or the Multiverse even though every other universe will Probably have to deal with Thanos
Back to it once again. Revisiting past.
Legend watch the trailer after 5time seen the movie 🎥
Avengers endgame must be release  in this year
agreed.
This was the absolute peak of Marvel and their popularity. What a glorious time, this trailer still gives me goosebumps.
Me who watch this trailer every week the only movie that we can watch again and again for years❤
It’s monologue with everyone’s voice
In this trailer we see Hulk but in Movie 😅
YouTube recommend this after 5 years
There was no hulk in the final battle like shown in this trailer end .... Though Best ad ever!
Me still trying to find this scene at 1:59 😅
Here after miss marvels trailer 😢
Please return Ironman 😢
Rip black panther. Wakanda forever!
It's shame to say that it's the same studio which released she hulk.. 😔
It's been five years 😢
الي راجع يشوف تريلر 2023 يخلي لايك❤😊
I see hulk there but in the movie I don't see him 😅
Thor: who the hell are you guys 😂😂😂😂
Youtube recommended this to me after 5 years
Know we just need kang to beat the ever living crud out of someone like thanos did to hulk
Ho le lacrime
Nothing in mcu is comparable to The Avenger (initiative)
Anybody noticed hulk in last scene whereas this was not shown in movie
By the infamous Stark mode 🎉
This movie is batter than avatar.
Bruh you noticed after 5 years 😳
July 21,2023, Friday, 07:35 after lockdown and after 5 years of this movie realise everything seems different!!!
Thank you youtube for recommending this video after 6 years 👍😅
And now... Look at the Marvel 🤧
Bruh they should of added Hulk...
Captain 🔥
Did anyone noticed that Hulk was running in Wakanda in the Trailer but not in the movie!?
2:00 this was from probably the deleted scene where Bruce banner becomes hulk in the climax wakanda battle as we can see hulk here running...
Yeah but the ending scene.. he wasn't hulk in that fight
Had to revisit this 🤌💯
i hope this movie ends good. Bad guy loses and good guy wins, thats how movies work 😣
Ahh good old days
It’s…been 5 years???
I have seen many trailers but nothing matches the level of this trailer
Ahhh....'member when you were excited to see a Marvel movie?

Yeahhh....I 'member...
marvel had the world in their hands and they sold
❤❤
The Hulk Thing us right 😂
Will Thanos appear in the movie??? 😮
❤
❤
Believe me, I did
In this movie,its the opposite
I remember I used to be so excited for the next marvel project. But after endgame I see no point
😅😂
After 5 Years I Am Present 👍
What, the Hulk wasn't in Wakanda
I was part of the blip, I just came back this yr too😂😂
മർവൽ ❤️❤️❤️
There was an idea…
Can’t believe this was 5 years ago wow
the sound track is Imminence by Really Slow Motion but its been edited with the avengers theme
RIP MCU
❤❤😢😢
Peak MCU
It’s been half a decade.
Still this >>>>>endgame
Hulk is in the final battle. but how?
Fun fact : Hulk was only part of infinity war trailer, but not the movie.
2:01 what is hulk doing there?
If only they didn’t nerfed Hulk
Marvel need to step it up again!
Watch on repeat
Tbh... If any of Avengers had been in his supreme version..Thanos would have died by then.
Chills!
Больше 200 раз смотрел за все время  5 лет назад, не шучу))
Ikr
He was there
​​ @nkatekomasonto9548 They're talking about how he wasn't in his hulk form in the movie during the battle of Wakanda like this trailer showed. He was just Bruce Banner in the hulk buster suit. We only saw him as hulk in the beginning of the movie.
They will
1:59 how hulk is here in the trailer if he is not in the original movie in wakanda
Infinity war me Hulk kaha tha bhai 😂😂😂
Miss when marvel was actually good
2:00 What was Hulk doing there
Hulk in Earth OMG
🤦🤦🤦
After trailer hulk left the chat 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Dr. Bruce banner was never Hulk in the infinity war.. he had the hulkbuster suit
Bring us back to the good ole'd days when the MCU has stakes, consequences, and compelling characters.
*ENDGAME WAS EPIC LEGENDERY BUT INFINITY WAR WAS SUPER SUPER LEGENDARY MOVIE IN THE WORLD 🌎🌎🥶🥶🥶🥵🥵🥵🥵🔥🔥🔥🔥💯🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😎😎😎😎💪🏼💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
And in 5 yrs Marvel has turn to S***T Thats why love the trailers...I too have the feel
If tobey maguire would be alive , then he would simply put some dirt on Thanos eyes 😅😅😅😅😅😅
Still goosbumps
❤❤❤❤
Great trailer, but they really got us with that fake Hulk
Как-будто вчера, а не 5 лет назад.
And then we waiting for Kang Dynasty
Am here bcoz I have found the Fun fact @2:00 this scene not there in movie 😂
This is 2023 … i still watch this..
I am watching it again
Better than Endgame btw and it's not very close
For me Infinity war is the greatest superhero movie of all time while Endgame is barely a top 10 mcu movie not counting outside the mcu, maybe in the top 8 or 9
The last spectacular marvel movie
Take me back
Wtf it's been 5 years
Avengers are nothing without Captain America, iron man and thor
1:59
Mate: Me acuerdo cuando Hulk peleo contra los sirvientes de Thanos
Mcqueen: Mate eso nunca paso
Iske thumbnail mein to incredible Hulk h 😂😅Kiya hua kahan gaya puri movie ne mein nahin dikha
I miss you guys ❤❤ come back 😢😢😢😢
Where Marvel peaked
AVENGERS whispers* assemble
I can't live with Marvel's failure's....where did it bring me....back to this trailer
Happy 5 years old!
Dread it, run from it, destiny arrives all the same - Chef Boyardee
cant wait for kang dynasty
Grandiose même des années plus tard
Sorry endgame but this was the best movie-going experience I've ever had, hands down
The last great Marvel Movie, That deceptive trailer tho 😂
Tomorrow it would be 5 years
Old day 😢
Here again I miss 2018 
Prime Fortnite 
Life was good
Wishing this wasn’t over
5 years!
Abba thor to jinda ha
oh yes
Well say
my one of the no 1 biggest movie
Thanos was right, just saying...
2.00 banner is in hulk form😮
When we will again take this vibe marvel?
Ahh simpler times when marvel knew what they were doing, now it’s just…🤦🏾‍♂️
Infinity War is the best among the avengers
As we know that in trailer the mcu show the hulk in his mode but in infinity war movie they don't show the hulk in his mode they show the robotic hulk 😢 I don't know this is a mistake or nor 😊
People will move on but not us. To watch trailer
They need to bring Galactus. Kang is good but he is not as great as thanos
Still Hulk There
NO way this was 5 years ago
For russian this beautiful!)
Hulk running in the background is the biggest scam
This movie is more about thor and thanos
5 years ago♥️
April 27 2023… 5 years later🥲❤️
why did they show how iron man felt after Spiderman died
What the Hulk is going on 😅
2023,  that's my all time favorite movie 😢
humans and movies peaked here
Probably in 2027 i wish that...
Daniyal it kinda is, hulk was never in wakanda
​@Eden Hazard Fan  it wasn't. Banner not being Hulk was a major plot point and would have been given away if the Hulkbuster suit was shown
Dude. In the comics, Kang literally killed Thanos.
 @Saaaaaaac  it's not about who kills who or how strong. I mean they did not do kang character justice. He is good but he does not bring intensity and threat like Thanos did. I think it was a bad move to introduce kang in antman
where did the epicness go man 😞
DC needs to learn how to put up a trailer.
Is funny how they put the big green guy but he was never in the movie
Wait they put post snap clip at the beginning🤯
Marvels never reaching this level again
Hulk came in the trailer
Lol just noticed they showed hulk in the trailer 2:00
Good
Most viewed trailers of all time
It reminds It's a matterr of time.
Why this not getting OLD
Plot was leaked during the first few seconds of the trailer lol.Tony being sad on Titan indicates one thing.They lost!
nah this wasn't 5 years ago i want to go back plz
As great as this movie was. Half of this trailer didn't even happen.
Anyone see that Hulk in wakanda 1.59  min but not in movie there's only Hulk buster
Peak mcu is a thing
True Bousou Turboness; appropriate response to the Doku Boubou no Jutsu
After 5 years 😅
Legends are watching in 2023 😂😂
The Way They Running It Not In The Movie
It died when ironman died
Kgf 2
​ @user-kr5te7of4d never 😂
There was an idea.... Catches me here
Marvel fell off after Stan Lee compare this masterpiece to the new captain marvel trailer💀
Just realized there’s hulk in this trailer during the wanan da scene
2:00 HULK 😂😂😂 INFINTY WAR ME HULK NAHI THA HULK BUSTER THA
Who  was see this after movie released 😅😅
i wish i wasnt 11 fricking years old when i saw this and didnt remember it only entering and leaving (probably slept) and then watching it once it got onto disney plsu to then realize tf nothing makes sense and ruining the whole storyline for myself
algum Brasileiro revendo isso
GOAT 🐐
Luxury movie
In this year Avengers win the battle 😭🤍🔥
I'M STILL WATCHING THIS MOVIE 
BOY FROM SOUTH INDIA ☺
wow
There is hulk in the trailer but not in the movie why 🤔🤔🤔
This was MCU at it's prime. They're making straight up trash now compared to this
This trailer’s music >>>>>>
endgame was great but the MCU peaked here
🧜🏻‍♂️😍🤩  im here folks 🔱
Yo, 259m views can't believe am rewatching this in 2023
2023 watch ❤‍🔥
Can anybody explain at 2:01 how hulk at back
Yes
Biggest mistake ever 😂 bro marvel suddenly change Story of movie
Well MCU did make alot of mid movies in infinity saga and it's not fair to compare infinity war and endgame to multiverse solo films 
Let see about this comparison after avengers 5&6
July 2023
This trailer still watched
The Way They Running It Not In The Movie
😎
Rhodey = Skrull
1:59 they saw hulk in trailer but there is no hulk in movie during wakanda battle
Again 😍
How does any channel have 200million views just for a trailer 😂😂
Hulk? Where Was Hulk In The Whole Infinity War? Why is he in thumbnail And Trailer?
Who’s here in 2023 looking at the newest comment 🤣
Anyone else here, reminiscing when MCU used to be good?  Just went downhill from here.
Good
IMAX!
Cuando Marvel era bueno
I miss these days. The actual excitement was there with the MCU films. Now, MCU is DEAD.
anybody noticed HULK
I like heroes movies
change the thumbnail now marvel..been a while 😂😂🤣🤣
It's 2023 but still....
Tony Stark is so hot.
One day, we will look back, and wonder how MARVEL got so bad...
😅😅😅
I feel bad for people that feel like this. After Endgame, lots of people like you checked out. I binged all the marvel shows and each one made Endgame feel like just the beginning. It’s fine if you feel like it’s dead, but for me it definitely is not.
Not yet wait and see
Yep, the hype for infinity war was umatched
Disney +.. marvel had to deliver series and watered down storylines
When Thanos snaps, half of their intelligent writers turn into dust as well
I was coding peacefully and suddenly Copilot generated me this link in the middle of a comment. No ideal how this happened.
Abe infinity war me hulk kya kr rha he 😂😂
Love u 3000 ...in year 09/05/2023
Honestly, endgame should've never happened maybe. Had I wished a more darker world after Decimation.
How many of you are watching kgf chapter2 teaser and watching this teaser.
Why in thumbnail hulk running towards Thanos??🤔
Infinity war >>>>>> endgame
No tengo miedo ya mo el miedoooo😅😂😂😂😂😂❤
Incriebli😊1000
nat,I miss you
Mcu those days...
5 лет..💔
bro where tf was hulk in the last fight???
Who remembers the rumors of captain America dying
There were no hulk at the end part bruhh
Thor op
Wtf 5 years ?
They don’t make em like this anymore
Never forget
There not even battling in the forest instead its a plain field
Endgame should never be in the same sentence as infinity war.
Endgame is amazing specially that third act but infinity war is the goat marvel movie for me
Bhai isme hulk kaha se agya 🙄 movie mai to hulk tha hi nhi hulk Baster soot pehna hota hai bener nai
this movie was 10/10, but would have been 11/10 if hulk smashed.
god they did hulk so dirty in this movie tho, such a shame.
Don’t know why but I’m here in 2023
Legends are watching in 2023
Legends watching in 2023
Kgf 2 teaser like 👍 99 lakh like power of india
Hulk??😅😅
1 Aug 2023  for memorial infinity war✋💜💙❤️🧡💚💛
I am inevitable

My almost perfect movie 😢😂🎉
A sad movie...
Peak marvel
Where was drax?
what I never liked is that they lied to us in that trailer hulk never fought in wakanda it was bruce with the iro man suit
🥹 it’s been so long..
Kon kon is 2023 me dekh raha hai ❤
Watching this again in 2023
This is sad I was 6 when this released
Yeah we really need to see the savage hulk come back!
 @clawsmasher1741  hopefully he'll come back in secret wars
But this movie is far better than kgf 2 and 1
And I am IRONMAN
Me
MAN...
😎😎😎😎😎
Eramos felices. Que te hicieron MCU...
1:37
Lmao
2:00 biggest scam is the trailer shows hulk in wakanda 🗿
Am I weird? I absolutely loved this film, but hated Endgame.
World saddest trailer
This halk😅😅😅
5 years ago!!!!! Bruuuuh!
😮😮😮
2:00 hulk? Was there any hulk in infinity war?
😢
1:59 
Trailer hulk
Movie hulkbuster😂😂
One and only KGF-1,2 .... is the king of world
already 5years . hm
Yeah Now the MCU in the ruins
What hulk is doing in the last?
Avengers vs justice league?
Ah the end of the MCU with End Game, And the start of the MsheU
Thanks was right ....after his death in endgame....MCU is screwdd
LMAO I JUST NOTICED IT
I mean Endgame is good but Endgame is an insult as a sequel to Infinity war.
Its just doesnt compare
They changed that, only in the beginning, later it was fat ironman suit.
🇮🇳Indian,is there anyone here KGF fans?
Kid 
In comics Marvel have 12,700 characters and half of them are ladies 
You know even Infinity stones are also there because of a Goddess name Nemesis 
This is what I hate about new marvel fans 
You guys just joined our fandom 5 years ago and totally destroyed it
 @shlomocohen6743  so you like She Hulk i get it
 @skalforce  She-Hulk isn't the only female character. As Shlom said, there are a ton of female characters in the comics.
 @skalforce  nah u like wanda
 @lazergaming5652  idm female characters, im just saying the way they implemented em with an agenda, no character building no struggles and guess whos the bad characters and stupid villains ! Besides the story is pointless no high stakes and no progressing to the point of the MCU, phase 4 just sad and pointless tho i enjoyed spiderman no way home and i just watched the GOTG Vol 3 and it was good bcuz they added something new and its character development ( rocket ) these are the type of the marvel movies we grew up with..
Edit : she-hulk is just an example of phase 4, and our favorite characters gone though the winds, marvel used to be strong and sad, joy and action that actually make the audience hooked up, look at now, not just M-SHE-U but Bad comedy all the time ...
5 YEARS AGO???
crying
The Drama continues.
Hulk not in fight 🙂
you guys still here in 2023?
When MCU was at its peak (where there is no feminism or LGbTQ bullshits Goin on)
Where is kgf2 trailer???
It is top viewed trailer on YouTube
Hulk was not in Wakanda fight
ಕನ್ನಡಿಗರು ಯಾರಾದ್ರೂ ನೋಡ್ತಿದೀರಾ ♥️👍
Not even a marvel fan but infinity war was better than endgame.
I think the more of MCU fans in here tends to give a slack on the DCEU
For you guys who don't see the good things first in DC movies, you tend to be reactive always
Comparing the MCU movies with that of the DC is just like comparing an iphone and Samsung Galaxy which in sense the iphone is more liked by people world wide due to the design, the structure, the contents, the sleek body nature and stuff s like that, that's what the MCU looks like,a good masterpiece with contents and stories to keep people teased and relaxed.
The Samsung Galaxy is a phone of it's own with less popularity than the iphone but has a compact and blockbuster content filled with energy, that's the DC,
Not too many talking points but the actions and the darkest parts, twisted storylines that makes it one in a million.
Even though this trailer cannot beat KGF chapter 2 trailer...in number of views
Iwant re release this movie
Who's watching in 2023 🙄
Five years ago we lost
Who's here after the Kang dynasty and secret wars?
Only me & me!

Born MSheU 🤡💩🦄🤮
I just see hulk 2:00
It was banner
Such a 🚀
😂😂what
They have not even released yet😂😂
The kang dynasty and secret wars title reveal is lackluster though unlike infinity war
Bhai isme hulk dikhaya gaya hai wakanda mai or movie mai dikhaya gaya ki hulk iron man ka suit  mai rahkar lada

Infinity War is better than Endgame!
Anyone watching 2023 ?
Why they show Hulk
I'm iron man
Hulk kaha se aa gaya
the thumbnail hulk is fake, as we get to see a hulkbuster show.
2023❤
Maturity is when you realise Thanos was the real hero of this film
Why is this on my yt homepage
... Who is also very interesting
But there is no Hulk in movie
2:00 hulk was hit by thanos at the beginning of the movie, this is click bait HAHAHAAH
Hulk 😂 not reall 🎉
Trailer me pich Hulk bhaag Raha h or movie me Bruce Hulk bna hi nhi
I'm here in 2023😢
Life time agod ☹️
❤😂😅😢
2:01 they showed hulk in the background but he was never in infinity war
I can agree
No 
IW= ENDGAME
Comparing endgame to infinity war is an insult to infinity war.
Endgame has an amazing third act but Infinity war is like Endgame's third act levels of good but its stretch to 2 hours and 30 minutes
Explain
They deleate must of trailer clips
If you look so well
So little details arent in it
Right
He made his last appearance in the beginning.
to avoid spoilers
Who is here in 2023 ?!!
5 years ago 🗿
5 years ago dam
5 years ago ...
marvel never make this type of movie again..
🥲
Kuwaiti boy risen.
What FNAF game is this?
Got robbed of hulk
260 MILLION VIEWS
Anyone get this recommendation in 2023
Lol hulk never showed up in the end though, cmon Disney and Marvel
How is it possible "Despacito" has over 1 billion views and this trailer doesn't?
a
men. Hallelujah.
In 2023 anyone❤...
❤😂 q oecao jajajaja 😢
Guardianes de la Galaxia Vol. 3 >>>> End Game
RDJ pls come back mcu is losing miserably
🥲
The Infinity Saga was Marvel’s Golden Age. This was awesome before all the woke bullshit
I didn't even realize that lol that's funny.
World is strange isn't it?
This trailer doesn't need to reach 1 billion views to prove that the movie is great. Everyone knows it. Besides, trailers for movies are very different from music.
@HyperUltron I'm trying to understand you, but this clip wasn't released in China, was it? After all, there are almost 2 bi of slanted eyes, there should be a lot more views, don't you agree Old man?
This happens when freak people have not emotion.
You freak
ENDGAME= Infinity war>>>>>>>>>>>>>any movie's of the world
The time when marvel was great
بالله
Avengers

Are you a time-traveler because we're in 2023 bud, we're not 9 years into the future yet because it's been 5 years since Infinity war came out in 2018 lol.
5 anos 😢
Dam😢 it been 5 yrs
bruh spider man no way home has now more than 350m+ views across all platforms so the fact is Marvel >>> Any South Indian franchise
Yep❤️
Funny, cause the heroes actually lost
The Heroes lost in infinity war, have you actually watched the film?
 @Infinite-void908  probably both
 @TheRealLegoDocOck  It was a joke bro
